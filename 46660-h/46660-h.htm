<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">PREFACE</h2>


<p>Sainte-Beuve, after an attempt that one cannot describe
as successful, declared that “it is hardly possible to write
the life of M. de Talleyrand.” Frédéric Masson noticed
the figure of the great diplomatist as he passed with a
disdainful “ce Sphinx.” Carlyle forgot his dogmatism
for a moment, and pronounced Talleyrand “one of the
strangest things ever seen or like to be seen, an enigma
for future ages.” Even a woman of penetration, Mme.
de Staël, who had known him well, assures us that
he was “the most impenetrable and most inexplicable
of men.”</p>

<p>There were a few who thought that the long-sealed
“Memoirs” of the Prince, which were published only
a few years ago, would reveal every secret. They forgot
that these were the work of the man who held
(improving on Voltaire) that “speech was given to man
to disguise his thoughts”&mdash;the man who conducted his
exit from the world with all the art he had used at the
Congress of Vienna. Yet, if the “Memoirs” have
thrown no light, or only a deceptive light, on some of
the obscurer passages in Talleyrand’s career, they have
at least filled in our picture of his personality, so that
the tradition of its inscrutability must be surrendered.
There has been a prolonged and microscopic research
into the age or ages of Talleyrand,&mdash;the Old Regime,
the Revolution, the Consulate, the Restoration, and
the second Revolution. The memoirs of nearly all his
contemporaries have seen the light, and official records
everywhere have been examined. I have made a
careful use of all this research up to date, and
find it possible to present a consistent and intelligible
personality.</p>

<p>Lady Blennerhassett included the material of the
“Memoirs” in the biography of Talleyrand that she
wrote ten years ago. But a good deal of light has
since been thrown on the earlier part of his career,
and in this regard I gratefully avail myself of the
investigations of M. de Lacombe. Moreover, Lady
Blennerhassett is chiefly occupied with the Prince’s
diplomatic action. His personality does not stand
out very clearly from her very crowded canvas. That
is an inherent disadvantage in writing the life of a
great diplomatist. However, in spite of the alluring
character of the stretch of history across which the
thread of Talleyrand’s life passes, I have tried to
keep it in its place as a background, and to bring out
into the fullest light the elusive figure of the man who
made and unmade a dozen oaths of loyalty.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">BIBLIOGRAPHY</h2>


<p>This Study is chiefly based on the following Works:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="indent f08">1. Talleyrand’s “Mémoires” (edit, de Broglie, 5 volumes); Official
Correspondence from London in 1792, during the Directoire,
during the Vienna Congress, and from London in 1830-4 (edit.
Pallain); Letters to Napoleon, Mme. Adélaide, D’Hauterive,
Choiseul-Gouffier, the Duchess of Courland, Bacourt, Royer-Collard,
Guizot, and others; and his separately published
Speeches and other Documents.</p>

<p class="indent f08">2. “Procès-verbal Historique des Actes du Clergé;” “Procès-verbal
de l’Assemblée Nationale;” “Histoire Parlementaire” (Bouchez
et Roux); and the Memoirs or Letters of Arnault, Barante,
Carnot, Consalvi, von Gagern, Mme. de Genlis, Guizot, Lauzun,
Las Cases, Macdonald, Meneval, Miot de Melito, Morellet,
Napoleon, Pasquier, Mme. de Rémusat, Savary, Senfft, and
Stapfer.</p>

<p class="indent f08">3. Of Biographies or Biographical Sketches of Talleyrand the chief
are those by Lady Blennerhassett (the first authority on his
diplomatic career), Brougham, Castellane, Castille, Lacombe (the
best authority on his ecclesiastical career), Sir H. Bulwer Lytton
(a very generous but imperfectly informed study), Mignet,
Montarlot, and Place et Florens. The following writers are too
imaginative or too prejudiced to be of much value: Bastide,
Colmache, Marcade, Michaud, Pichot, Sainte-Beuve, Sallé,
Stewartson, Touchard-Lafosse, Vars, and Villemarest.</p>

<p class="indent f08">4. Subsidiary information has been derived chiefly from “Aus dem

F. Talleyrand;” Aulard’s “Histoire Politique de la Révolution
Française;” Caro’s “La Fin du XVIII Siècle;” Crétineau-Joly’s

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">THE TRAINING OF A DIPLOMATIST</span></p>


<p>The life-story of Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord,
as I propose to write it, begins when, in his
third or fourth year, he falls off a chest of drawers and
permanently injures his foot. That wrench of muscles
and tendons, making him limp for life, led to a perverse
action on the part of his educators that did equal violence
to an excellent natural disposition. They say now that
the education of a child begins a hundred years before
he is born. In the case of Talleyrand you may just as
well say a thousand. On his father’s side he came of
one of the oldest noble families in France, and his
mother was a daughter of the Marquis d’Antigny. But
these hereditary influences only shape the general contour
of his character&mdash;give the refinement, the instinct to
rise (Talleyrand, or Tailleran&mdash;as Napoleon always
pronounced it&mdash;is said to be from “tailler les rangs”),
the “sensibility” and “spirituality” (as people spoke
then), the self-possession. When you wish to trace the
growth of the peculiar traits of Prince Talleyrand, you
find the beginning in that fateful fall and dislocation of
the foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span></p>

<p>The boy was born in 1754, in the Rue Garancière,
at Paris.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The week that followed was the only week
he ever spent under the same roof with his mother,
though she lived for fifty years afterwards, and he never
quarrelled with his family. There was no tender rearing,
no loving study and direction of the young life in those
days. Rousseau had not yet persuaded France that a
mother’s duty did not end with an impatient and
querulous parturition. Talleyrand’s father and mother
were both in the service of the Court. It was an age
when a king could not go to bed without two or three
nobles to hand him his night-dress; and when, on the
other hand, nobles could not live without sharing the
king’s purse to the extent of some forty million livres.
Estates had been mortgaged and starved; Court life had
become ever more luxurious and exacting. The system
only held together by a frail structure of privileges,
sinecures and commissions, that bound the nobility
closer and closer to Versailles and left a yawning gulf
between them and the people.</p>

<p>That gulf was not to be seen for thirty years
yet, and meantime the life of the idle was swift and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>strenuous. In such a life the arrival of children was
an accident, a complication. They must at once be
put away to nurse, then to school, and finally be placed
in the system. Lieutenant-General de Talleyrand-Périgord
was better than most of his class, but a
busy, and not a wealthy, man. Charles Maurice was
immediately put to nurse in the suburbs, and so
successfully forgotten that when, in his fourth year,
it was decided to remove him, he was found to be
lamed for life owing to the unskilful treatment of the
injury to his foot. Through the death of his elder
brother he should have been entitled to the right of
primogeniture&mdash;the right to the one good position in
the army that could be demanded of the King. But
the thought of a Colonel Talleyrand limping along the
galleries at Versailles or exhibiting an ill-shaped foot
on parade was insufferable. He was destined to the
service of the Church. Talleyrand himself pondered
at a later date over the long-drawn consequences of
his accident. When Royalist agents sought his powerful
influence for the restoration of the King, he observed
that but for that early mishap he would probably be with
them amongst the <i>émigrés</i> and royal ambassadors.</p>

<p>At the time it fell out his horizon was bounded
by the cabbages and gooseberry bushes of a suburban
garden, but in his fourth year he was transferred to
a larger sphere. For seventeen days his wondering
eyes saw the great world unfold before them, as the
coach went from Paris to Bordeaux. A few days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
later he was in a stately chateau with a very stately
princess caring for him. Little by little he would
learn the idea of lordship. The Princess de Chalais
was his great-grandmother, the representative of a family
that had ruled the district for eight centuries. He
saw the homage of her little court, the group of
elderly gentlemen who were no longer needed at
brilliant Versailles. He saw a broad country-side,
where not a steeple or monument could catch his eye
but he was told his ancestors had reared it. On
Sundays he saw her courtiers carry her prayer-book
in the red velvet bag, and he knelt on his chair
near her <i>prie-dieu</i>, and felt the admiring glances of the
peasantry. After mass he saw&mdash;he has described it all
so tenderly in his memoirs&mdash;the sick and needy of the
estate trail after them to the chateau, where the old
lady sat in her velvet chair in the “dispensary,” and
the huge pots of ointment (of which the recipes were
kept in the family) were opened, and two Sisters of
Charity interrogated the applicants, and the Princess
cut up the lint and linen with her own hands, and
directed her courtiers to deal out the syrups and
ointments. He saw the old regime at its best.</p>

<p>The four years that the boy spent at Chalais had a
deep influence for good on him. The Princess loved
him: she was almost the only one to awaken his finer
feelings in those years of formation, and we shall find
them, recalling those kindly days, long after the terrible
ordeal that was to follow, in the blood-spattered streets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
of Paris and on the reeking battle-fields of Napoleon.
As he grew up he must have wondered at times why,
through those eight long years he never felt the kiss of
a mother or heard the cheering voice of his distinguished
father. Then he would learn of Paris and Versailles,
and how the splendour of Chalais was only a distant
reflection of the life that streamed out from the capital.
At last he was to return to Paris, to see his parents, to
ask by what path <i>he</i> was to enter into that life. He
was eight years old, a sharp, observant, sensitive and
ambitious boy.</p>

<p>Then the trial began, and the de-formation of his
better instincts. While his young mind was nervously
tracing its large ambition a family-council was disposing
of his body and soul, without a glance at anything but
his foot. A valet met him at the coach-office at Paris
and took him straight to school. Where were his
parents? Where was Versailles? The little lips
contracted. He found himself in the dull, stuffy
atmosphere of one of the oldest schools in Paris, the
Collège d’Harcourt (now the Lycée St. Louis). It lay
just off the present Boulevard Michel, its grounds
touching those of the Cordeliers. It was a recognised
school for children of good families; in fact, his father
left him to pay in later years for his own education.
At dinner on the first day he sat next to a future
ambassador, a nephew of the great Choiseul. He shared
the room and tutor of a cousin. But the teachers were
poor (except his teacher of philosophy), and were chiefly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
expert in the “Almanach de la Cour.” In the course of
his four years there Talleyrand picked up a fair acquaintance
with the subjects taught at the time&mdash;French
history and letters, logic (greatly esteemed at Paris, and
of very obvious influence on his papers afterwards),
rhetoric, Latin, philosophy, and a little mathematics.
He was industrious and an assiduous reader.</p>

<p>Long afterwards his experience of the Collège
d’Harcourt was to lend colour to his denunciation of
pre-Revolutionary education. But the poorness of his
intellectual training was the smallest sin committed
against him in those days. The neglect of his character,
his personality, was fatal. An affectionate interest on
the part of his parents might have prepared him for
the coming disappointment, but it was wholly denied.
In his memoirs he speaks with a singular respect of
them; at one time he even ventures to suggest that
they probably kept away from him lest, in their great
love, they should lose the courage to carry out the
resolution to commit him to the Church! His father
lived until 1788 and his mother until 1809, yet he
never spent a week under the same roof with them.
On Sundays one of the teachers would take him to
dine with them, and after a formal hour or two his
father would pat his head and tell him to “be good
and obey Monsieur l’Abbé.” His finer qualities were
irreparably neglected. His school-fellows were good
comrades, but the eternal dulness of the place and
the restraint of his parents depressed him. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
not an uncommon experience in this regard. You
find much the same complaint about their school-days
in the memoirs of most of his contemporaries. The
particular difficulty in Talleyrand’s case was the absence
of any encouraging words about the future. By this
time he had begun to think about it. Gradually,
he understood hints that it was not the fine halls
of Versailles or the adventures of the camp, but
the sombre world of the Church, to which he was
destined. In his twelfth year, about the end of his
college days, he caught the small-pox, and was hurried
off to the house of a strange nurse in the Rue Saint-Jacques.
Somehow he survived the deadly treatment
usual at that time&mdash;great fires and hermetically-sealed
windows&mdash;and escaped marking. But in his convalescence
he pondered again on the absence of his
mother.</p>

<p>The time had now come for an open statement
about his future. It seems probable that he was sent
then, in 1766, to visit his uncle, who had just become
coadjutor to the Archbishop of Rheims. It is likely
enough that his parents would try to seduce him from
military ambition by a sight of the archbishop-count’s
brilliant ecclesiastical court, and Talleyrand affirms in
his memoirs that he was taken from the college to
Rheims. However, it was probably some time later that
he spent a year with his uncle, as he talks of being in his
fifteenth year. Mme. de Genlis says that she saw him at
Rheims in his “eleventh or twelfth” year, but she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
describes him as wearing a soutane, so that she also
probably refers to a later date. Whether or no he then
visited Rheims, it is clear that in his twelfth or thirteenth
year he was sent to Saint Sulpice, and shrank to find
himself in the soutane.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to recall that this was a
common practice in the eighteenth century in France,
and in many other times and places. Bossuet and
Fénélon had protested religiously against the custom,
but it continued to the full, almost without a single
complaint, in Talleyrand’s day. The effect on the
Church itself was disastrous. Scores of younger or
illegitimate sons of the nobility were forced into it
against their inclination, and they adopted within it the
Voltairean scepticism and the looseness of morals which
the Army or the Court would have sanctioned. Just
at the crisis of its fortunes the Church found at its
head such men as the Cardinal de Rohan (the patron
of Cagliostro&mdash;in exile anent the famous necklace),
Loménie de Brienne and Dillon. It had not spoken
a syllable of protest when they were presented to it for
ordination, for the sole purpose of securing the
revenues, and neglecting the duties, of its rich abbeys
and bishoprics. Loménie de Brienne, in fact, had
deliberately chosen the Church as the best path for his
ambition, and resigned the secular primogeniture.
During the years of preparation for the Church he was
designing the plan of his archi-episcopal chateau and
dreaming of the political leadership of the country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
Most of them, like Talleyrand, were put into the
Church so as to relieve the strain on the king’s coffers
at its expense. It had been decided, and was afterwards
formally decreed, that no commission in the army should
be given to any but a noble, and still the supply was
excessive; though the King’s personal service cost forty
million livres a year, and that of the Queen a further
five millions. Then they turned to the Church, with
its income of 150,000,000 livres a year, as a field for
younger sons. Wealthy bishoprics were appropriated
to the nobility, and wealthy abbeys&mdash;the income of the
Abbot of Saint Germain at Paris was 130,000 a year&mdash;were
handed over to them as <i>abbés commendataires</i>,
which might be translated “absentee landlords.”</p>

<p>But I will return presently to the character of the
clergy on the eve of the Revolution. Though wealth
and prestige and political power were to be had in the
clerical profession, the young Talleyrand bitterly resented
his situation. By a healthy instinct he felt that, as later
experience showed, he was totally unfitted for the
Church. Hence he quickly developed a habit of silent
and cynical observation, of disregard for authority and
conventional ideals, and of unhealthy isolation and self-possession.
Many years afterwards an emigrant bishop,
who had been a schoolfellow of his at Saint Sulpice,
recalled how he used to say to his one or two close
friends: “They want to make a priest of me, but they
will have an unpleasant time of it.” He himself says
that he hardly spoke a word during the first three years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
at the seminary. His recreation hours were spent in its
splendid library, where he sought especially the lives of
statesmen “and moralists,” works of travel and adventure,
and books that described all kinds of violent movements
and upheavals in Nature and the social order. He had
not the temperament of a revolutionary; his experience
and reading led rather to a complete atrophy of his
power of devotion to an idea or an institution. In his
theology he would read how the service of religion
demanded perfect ministers&mdash;“victims without blemish,”
in the words of the Church; yet his superiors blandly
accepted those who were rejected by army or Court.
He saw injustice and hypocrisy on every side, and
concluded that loyalty and devotion were masks. So,
as time went on, he retreated more and more within
himself, made his own interest the measure of his
acquiescence, and learned the essential qualities of a
diplomatist. In later years he saw advantages in the
training. It was well to have been thus “dipped in the
waters of the Styx.” He never spoke or wrote a harsh
word of his parents,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> or of Saint Sulpice, or of the
Church. “Well, God keep his soul, but I like him,”
said Pius VII of Talleyrand, after his first struggle with
Napoleon.</p>

<p>After two or three years at Saint Sulpice he was sent
on a long visit to his uncle at Rheims. Archbishop
Talleyrand (he was then Archbishop <i>in partibus</i>) was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>conscientious and high-minded prelate, who suffered
much in after years from the conduct of his favourite
nephew. He tried to reconcile the boy with his
profession. The Archbishop of Rheims, the Count de
la Roche-Aymon, was a prelate of dignity and intellect,
and an imposing figure at archi-episcopal functions.
With his episcopal income and the Abbey of Saint-Germain-aux-Près
(a total annual income of 180,000
livres), besides private means, he was not one of the
wealthiest prelates, but his see was of great importance,
and his splendour would have dazzled a youth with any
disposition to the clerical career. But the encouragement
of the two prelates and all the glory of their functions
were quite lost on young Talleyrand. He says in his
memoirs that all this prestige did not seem to him “worth
the sacrifice of his sincerity.” That is obviously an
after-thought. It was an instinctive consciousness of his
unfitness for the celibate state and for religious ministry
that moved him. Madame de Genlis saw him at Sillery
with his uncle, and noticed the pale, silent boy, with the
observant eyes, in soutane and skull cap. He probably
noticed Madame de Genlis in return, if he did not hear
something about that charming compound of philosophic
virtue and plebeian vice. A few such acquaintances and
a few small ecclesiastical dignities were all he ever
acquired at Rheims.</p>

<p>He says that his uncle put in his way the lives of
Richelieu and Ximenes and Hincmar, and the memoirs
of Retz, to show that the ecclesiastical life had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
possibilities. He would hardly need assistance in
discovering those helpful books. Now that the Church
<i>must</i> be embraced he formed his own view of it. It
should serve as a back-door to the pleasant world from
which they would exclude him. He would rejoin
young Choiseul and Madame de Genlis by-and-by. It
is a rather curious commentary on his training at this
time that a shrewd adventuress, who saw a good deal of
him under the Directorate, described him as a mixture of
Richelieu’s firmness, Mazarin’s finesse, de Retz’s
versatility, and a little of de Rohan’s gallantry. He
may have heard, too, of that questionable ancestor of
his in the fourteenth century, the Cardinal Hélie de
Périgord, in whose titular Church at Rome an inscription
recorded that “he was weak in religion but assiduous in
worldly things.” Cardinal Hélie, a friend of Petrarch,
had become an influential politician, had made a large
fortune in commerce, and had spent it pleasantly in the
patronage of art and luxury.</p>

<p>These ideas would take shape in time, as he
resigned himself to the ecclesiastical condition. In the
circumstances such a resignation could only take one
form. Month by month the restless youth, with the
whole adventurous history of the Périgords in his veins,
would contrast the dullness of his surroundings with the
dream of his boyhood. Had there been a profound and
general religious sentiment in the place, his earlier vision
might have been obliterated; but Voltaireanism was in
even the atmosphere of Saint Sulpice. There were good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
and sincere priests in the French Church then, as ever,
but some of its most prominent representatives were
known sceptics, and Hume and Voltaire were read in the
seminaries. In through the windows of his prison, too,
would come the laughter of Paris, the sound of the
bugle, the flash of the passing nobility. A youth devoid
of any natural religious disposition, with a horror of
ascetic plainness and heavy religious formalism, with a
quick, inborn faculty of irony, with a sensuous element
just beginning to stir in his blood, and a temperamental
craving for woman’s society, could never serve the
Church. The Church must serve him. He did not
discuss his moods with anyone. To most of his
companions he was morose and taciturn. To his
superiors he was a problem. One of his school-fellows
used to tell in later years<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> how on one occasion he was
reading in the refectory, and he came to a passage:
“And when the Chateau Tropette.” The superior
corrected him, and said “Trompette.” Talleyrand
coolly repeated the passage, and was again corrected.
He read it a third time, and quickly ran on before the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>superior could speak, “the Chateau Tropette, which the
ignorant have hitherto called the Chateau Trompette.”
We can well imagine that a discreet contempt of
authority and disdain of zeal were growing in him.</p>

<p>After a time he found the inevitable (and not unusual)
means to enliven the dulness of Saint Sulpice. He was
leaving the church one rainy morning when he noticed
a pretty girl without an umbrella. He offered a share
of his, escorted her home, and they saw each other
nearly every day for a long time. They were both
rebels. She had been sent on the stage against her wish.
This is the only irregularity Talleyrand confesses to at
that time, and there is no serious ground for entertaining
the wild stories of gambling and liaisons. The soundness
of them may be judged from the circumstance that
they suppose his father to have died some time before
(alleging that an <i>uncle</i> shuts him in the Bastille), whereas
the father lived for seventeen years afterwards. The
seminary authorities were not unwilling to purchase a
brighter disposition in their pupil at the price.
Talleyrand hints, too, that their liberality had some
regard for his connections and prospects.</p>

<p>This episode belongs to his eighteenth year. It is
the only authentic detail we have about his life after his
stay at Rheims in 1769 until 1774. In that year we
find him (in the records consulted by M. de Lacombe)
competing for what we should call a fellowship at the
Sorbonne. The thesis he sustained there on September
22nd was very edifying and successful. “What science<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
is most fitted for the lips of the priest?” was the
question he undertook to answer, and the published
discourse was piously dedicated to the Blessed Virgin.
It was his first essay in diplomacy. For priestly ideals
he cared not a tittle. But the world seemed to make it
a curious condition of success to do this sort of thing, a
polite recognition of the particular ante-chamber to
public life in which you found yourself. The maxims
of Richelieu and De Retz had taken root. The
conditions of advancement were repugnant to him, but
they were not chosen by him. As a young man of
culture in a philosophic age, he could not be expected to
take religion seriously. He had read much more of
Hume and Locke, of Montaigne and Voltaire, than of
Suarez. He became a bachelor of theology, and drew
near to the end of his dreary residence in the seminary.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">THE ABBÉ MALGRÉ LUI</span></p>


<p>It will hardly be thought that up to this point there is
any mystery about the person of Talleyrand. Many
types of character were produced by this enforcement
of the ecclesiastical profession. A few youths were
touched by the better influences of their surroundings,
and nobly turned to the great models of Bossuet and
Fénélon. A large number drifted impatiently through
the seminary, enlivened it with frequent dips into the
stream of Parisian life, and emerged as the philosophic
abbés and bishops we shall meet presently, ecclesiastical
only in title and purse. Many worked silently and
steadily through the years of study with a more or less
clear political ideal always in mind, using the general
education of the priest and the specific training of a
systematised theology for their ulterior purposes. Such
were Sieyès, Talleyrand, Fouché, Louis, Montesquiou,
Daunou, Reinhard, La Besnardière. It might have
been predicted at an early stage that Talleyrand would
fall in the third class. Then the peculiarly painful
circumstances of his exclusion from the more natural
career, which he so much desired, would make him
independent, self-centred, calculating, lightly cynical.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
Add a reasoned disbelief in religious teaching (though
it is impossible to say when this began), and we can
surely understand Talleyrand in his twentieth year,
gravely discussing priestly qualities from the Sorbonne
pulpit, while his heart is at Versailles. But we are a
long way advanced in the work of interpreting our
“Sphinx.”</p>

<p>About the close of Talleyrand’s course of study at
the seminary, Louis XVI was to be crowned at Rheims,
and Talleyrand’s parents invited him to assist at the
ceremony. His father was to have a function in the
proceedings, and his uncle would anoint the sovereign
if, as was feared, the aged Cardinal de la Roche-Aymon
was unable to do so. But this effort of Talleyrand’s
parents to interest him in his vocation only shows once
more how far they were from understanding his
character. Looking back on that splendid spectacle of
the coronation through the ghastly fires of the Revolution,
Talleyrand said that “never did so brilliant a
spring presage so stormy an autumn, so dire a winter.”
No doubt there were statesmen present who tried to
look up the darkening avenue, and wondered how the
honest young king and his beautiful queen would meet
the dangers that were gathering over the impoverished
country. To Sub-Deacon Talleyrand<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> the spectacle
must have held another element of tragedy. At the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>time it probably only afforded him a tantalising vision
of the gay world from which they would exclude him.
Such prestige as the priest had, with his golden cope
and sacramental oil and theatrical asceticism, was the
last kind he would think of seeking. No doubt he was
aware that it was an age of compromise. He would see
archbishops (such as Dillon and De Brienne), and
bishops and abbés without number, who had their
<i>belles amies</i> and boxes at the opera. The sight of them
made the Church less intolerable. He made their
acquaintance, was introduced to some of the great ladies
of Paris&mdash;the Duchess de Luynes, the Duchess de
Fitz-James, the Viscountess de Laval, and others. His
conversation seems to have shown already some of the
sparkle which made it so much sought later. He
pleased. Some of the most fashionable salons were open
to him, as soon as the Church should provide him with
an income.</p>

<p>The income was on its way. The story usually
runs that Talleyrand was one day in the salon of Mme.
du Barry with a lively group of young nobles. She
noticed his silence, and asked what he was thinking of.
“Alas! madame,” he is reported to have said, “I was
thinking how much easier it is to get an <i>amie</i> than an
<i>abbaye</i> at Paris.” The story concludes that he was at
once rewarded with the abbey of St. Denis, at Rheims,
with a revenue of 18,000 livres.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> As a fact, Talleyrand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>did not see the inside of Versailles until two or three
years after the death of Louis XV, and the disappearance
of Mme. du Barry. He did not become <i>abbé</i> until
more than a year later, and was not ordained priest until
much later still. M. de Lacombe has patiently traced
his early movements in the ecclesiastical records at
Rheims and Paris, and we are able to set aside most of
the legends of his precocious gaiety. However, he had
already begun to climb the ladder of ecclesiastical
preferment. In January he had been made (while yet
in minor orders) chaplain of the lady-chapel in the parish
church at Rheims. He then received the sub-deaconate,
and immediately after the coronation he was chosen by
the clergy of Rheims to represent them at the General
Assembly of the clergy. This was a singular distinction
for one of his age, barely in sacred orders (though one
other sub-deacon figures in the list of deputies), and it
compels us to suppose that he had won some attention.
A General Assembly of the Clergy met at Paris, as a
rule, every five years, to discuss the more important
affairs of the French Church. Each ecclesiastical province
sent four delegates, two of the order of prelates and two
of the lower clergy, and they sat from four to six
months, discussing their financial and political relation to
the State, as well as questions of discipline and religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>
<p>For those who would understand the conduct of
Talleyrand in later years, especially his “betrayal” of the
Church, it is necessary to see these scenes of his earlier
clerical days as he saw them. In the seminary he had
learned the stately Catholic ideal of the priest, but had
noted with even keener eye how ready the Church was
to compromise with it. At Rheims he had seen clearly
enough the relations of prelates and duchesses, the price
by which the Church retained its prestige in a Voltairean
world. At Paris the comedy&mdash;rapidly dissolving into
tragedy&mdash;would continue. In the convent of the Grands-Augustins
the thirty-two prelates, in rich surplices, sit in
their thirty-two fauteuils; behind each prelate sits, on a
“chair with a back,” the corresponding delegate of the
lower clergy in black mantle and square bonnet. The
first great question is: How much is the King going to
ask of us? For years jurists and politicians, and latterly
philosophers, had murmured at the exemption of the
clergy from taxation. The Church had only retained its
privilege by paying a few millions at each assembly in
the form of a “gratuitous gift.” But the amount of the
gift was fixed by the King, and it would fare ill with the
clergy if they refused it. In the increasing financial
distress the “gifts” grew larger and more frequent. At
this particular Assembly in July, 1775, the King’s
messengers announce that he asks sixteen millions<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> of
his devoted clergy. Cardinal de la Roche-Aymon, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>president, informs them that they lay the sum at his
feet&mdash;reminding him, however, of his promise at the last
Assembly to moderate his demands&mdash;and the messengers
withdraw.</p>

<p>Then the founts of clerical rhetoric are opened.
Talleyrand observes in his memoirs that “the intervention
of conscience in these money matters gave the
speeches a kind of eloquence that is peculiarly at the
command of the clergy.” The Archbishop of Auch
(with 120,000 a year from his bishopric alone) is
deputed to express the common feeling. They are
personally most eager to help their country, but the
resources they control belong to the service of God
and the altar. Is not the King confusing their goods
with the monies of “profane commerce”? They sink
under “immense burdens,” and are “exhausted” with
gratuitous gifts. [The Church has an income of
150,000,000 livres a year.] Cardinal de la Roche-Aymon
(with one religious sinecure alone worth 130,000
a year) nods acquiescence. Archbishop Dillon (160,000
a year and odd sinecures), Archbishop de Brienne (only
90,000 as yet&mdash;he is not yet Prime Minister), Archbishop
de la Rochefoucauld (100,000), and the other
prelates agree. Hardly a delegate but is <i>abbé commendataire</i>
of some place or other. The abbacy of
St. Bernard’s historic monastery, where the monks once
ate the leaves of the forest, is worth 400,000 a year.
The Benedictines of Saint-Maur (1,672 in number)
have a revenue of 8,000,000 livres. Cardinal Prince de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
Rohan has a total income of 2,500,000 a year, and
is heavily in debt. So is Dillon, who spends six
months of each year in hunting, and a great deal of
the rest in less healthy occupation. However, they will
contrive to find sixteen millions this time&mdash;and trust
the King will return it in other ways. The Abbé de
Périgord,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> pale, silent, in black mantle and square
bonnet, observes it all, and makes (internally) reflections
on venerable institutions and “zeal.”</p>

<p>In the course of the sittings several other questions
came on that were not without irony. Chief amongst
these were the decay of the monastic orders and the
growth of infidelity and Protestantism. Some of the
most powerful prelates in the Assembly, as well as
many deputies of the second order, were Voltairean
in opinion and less than Voltairean in practice. All
joined in the appeals to King and Pope to reform or
suppress the corrupt and decaying monastic bodies, to
stem the flood of philosophic literature, and to arrest
the growth of Protestantism. They were honest at
least in their attack on monasticism. It was one of
the ideas of the philosophers, and was rapidly spreading
amongst the people. Hardly a day passed now without
an attack on them, and Talleyrand says that not a pen
was lifted in their defence during the twenty years
preceding the Revolution. At the States-General in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>1789 one peasant deputy arrived with instructions to
work for the suppression of pheasants, rabbits, and
monks. Besides the usual struggle to disavow the
feudal obligations, which the Court lawyers were
constantly trying to fix on the clergy, the other
matters discussed were mainly disciplinary.</p>

<p>Such was Talleyrand’s initiation to the inner life of
the Church. Those who regret that, when he found
himself forced even involuntarily into the ecclesiastical
career, he did not endeavour to take a religious and
self-sacrificing view of it, will do well to ponder these
spectacles. Talleyrand’s course was natural. He used
the influence of the president, who had a strong liking
for him, to enter the gayer group of prelates. Dillon
and de Brienne opened a few more of the Parisian
salons to him. In the course of the sittings he had
been made “promoteur” (a kind of sub-secretary,
usually given a fair gratuity at the close), and was
appointed to an unimportant committee on the voting
counters and a very important one on religion and
jurisdiction. He claims that he won some distinction
in this Assembly, and was already marked for the high
position of Agent-General of the Clergy. In September
(1775&mdash;or eighteen months after Mme. du Barry has
quitted the scene) we find a notice in the <i>Gazette</i> that he
has been appointed <i>abbé commendataire</i> of the abbey of
St. Denis at Rheims, which brought him an income of
18,000 livres a year. The diplomatic career thus
began. The Pope confirmed the election of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
sub-deacon <i>abbé</i>, and the prior took possession in
Talleyrand’s name in December. As Chamfort put it,
the ecclesiastical bachelor naturally looked to a wedding
with some rich abbey to pay his debts. Bishops, Pope,
and King acquiesced in the system without a murmur.
All the bishops had sinecures of the sort, and the Court
contrived to keep a few vacant at times and pocket the
revenues. Talleyrand had not voluntarily entered the
ecclesiastical world, and he was determined to make it
serve his own ideal as far as possible. But one of his
first acts was to pay off the debt his parents still owed
to the Collège d’Harcourt.</p>

<p>Before going to Rheims he had applied for
admission into the Society of the Sorbonne and been
accepted (after formal proof of his moral and intellectual
qualities). He took up residence there after the close
of the Assembly. With his abbatial income (more than
£700 a year) and the prospect of scraps of political and
administrative work, he could have at once begun an
independent residence in Paris. But that would have
left him in the ambiguous position of a cleric and
celibate, cut off from the higher clerical distinctions and
possibilities. He must now complete his ecclesiastical
education in the usual way, and proceed by way of the
Agency-General (to come in 1780) to the episcopate.</p>

<p>However, the Sorbonne had not an intimidating
repute for austerity. The Abbé Morellet, who had
lived there with Turgot and de Brienne, describes in his
memoirs the condition of the Sorbonne, and the details<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
of what we may call its “fellowships,” in the eighteenth
century. Its library supplied him with Locke, Bayle,
and Clarke, as well as with Bellarmine and Aquinas.
He read Voltaire, and associated with Diderot and
d’Alembert. Theological studies of the old type were
pretty well out of fashion. His companions were very
generally imbued with the ideas of the philosophers.
This relaxation of the older discipline continued down
to the Revolution, and Talleyrand did not find residence
there irksome. He stayed there two years, wrote the
customary theses, and took a licentiate in theology on
March 2nd, 1778. He never tried for the doctorate.
But we may well believe that, as he says, he was “taken
up with quite other things than theology.” The success
of 1775 had stimulated him, and he spent many an hour
in the darkened chapel before the tomb of Richelieu.
He hints, too, that pleasure was his chief preoccupation,
though this is limited by a later statement that he was
unable to look up young Choiseul and find secular
friends until he had left the Sorbonne. About the
beginning of 1778 he completed his theological training
and plunged in the gaieties of Parisian life.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>So much has been written on the social life of the
wealthy and noble classes in France on the eve of the
Revolution, that I need say little more than that the
Abbé de Périgord, as he was now commonly styled, was
found in every brilliant salon and circle at Paris during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>the next ten years. “You do not know what it is to
live,” he would say indulgently to the new generation
in their restored gaiety after 1815. In some few respects
the pace of life had been moderated since the days of
Louis XIV, but in others it had increased. There
were no longer Pompadours and Du Barrys at Versailles,
but the King’s propriety was less noticeable than his

breakfasts and dinners and indigestions, his antics when
they were putting him to bed, and so on&mdash;and was quite
undone by his weakness. The cynical memoirs of
Lauzun show how little change there was in the
character of the Court. The imprudence and frivolity
of the beautiful young Queen, leaving Versailles to mix
with the masked crowd at the Opera when the King had
gone to bed (and being locked out by her tactless consort
at six in the morning), or gambling heavily with her
ladies until day-break, or giving far too substantial
ground for charges of gallantry, encouraged the rising
generation of nobles in their giddy dance in the crater
of a rumbling volcano. She was largely responsible for
the passion for heavy gambling that broke out. At
Marly her ladies had to change their dresses after
playing&mdash;soiled with the masses of gold wrung from an
almost bankrupt country. A vulgar American
adventurer could get the <i>entrée</i> of Versailles by letting it
be known that he had a large sum of money to lose; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>won in a short time 1,500,000 livres from his royal
shearers. Another man won 1,800,000 livres in one
evening. The thoughtless Count d’Artois, the King’s
brother, bet the Queen 100,000 livres that he would
build a palace in the Bois in six weeks; he won it&mdash;and
the 900 men he had employed scattered over Paris with
the story. Whoever could invent or import a new
sensation was sure of the Queen’s support. Racing was
introduced from England, and she flew to Sablons to lay
bets on the horses of her favourite, the too notorious
Lauzun. Then chariot races (some chariots costing ten
thousand crowns) varied the programme; and a society
was formed at Paris for the construction of a bull-ring.
Grave parliamentary lawyers and financial ministers
frowned, and were dismissed.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="caption">TALLEYRAND<br />

(A portrait taken in early life).</p></div>

<p>In dress, furniture and banquets the fashion was
equally luxurious and criminal. The age of Henri
Quatre took the fancy of the younger nobles, and they
tried to revive the splendid costumes of that time, but
the King interfered. Whole fortunes were spent on
fantastic head-dresses. Ladies drove among the impoverished
people and before bankrupt tradesmen with
structures two or three feet high on their heads, landscapes,
symbolic designs&mdash;the American Independence
hat, the racing hat, the vaccination hat, and so on.
Orders of chivalry were set up by this nobility that was
squeezing the blood out of the veins of the peasantry.
There was an Order of Perseverance, with statutes by
Mme. de Genlis, meetings in a gorgeous tent in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Lauzun’s garden, and costumes of white and grey and
silver; in this edifying company the initiate had to
answer a riddle, reply to a “moral question,” make a
speech in eulogy of some virtue, and&mdash;vow to redress
injustice and succour the poor and distressed! Clotho
and Lachesis must have smiled for once. There were
rival Orders of Patience and Felicity and what not.
Then Anglo-mania crept into their idle brains, and long
evenings were spent in discussing the excellence of
popular representation over tea and bread and butter,
and the geometrical gardens were Anglicised at great
expense, and Gobelins tapestry gave place to wall-paper.
And, in fine, we get a real novelty in the shape of
Cagliostro with his toad that had received all the
Sacraments, his innocent young girl, and his devils at
command. Cardinal-Prince de Rohan, with the two-and-a-half
millions a year and heavy debts, with the
alb worth 100,000 livres, with the twenty-five <i>valets de
chambre</i> and fourteen <i>maitres d’hotel</i>, had set him up in
his palace at Paris; and dashing colonels and elderly
countesses and philosophic abbés went to see Beelzebub
in the flesh. And the Fourth Estate was coming
rapidly to birth.</p>

<p>Into this giddy stream the Abbé de Périgord gladly
plunged. He was in his twenty-fourth year, still pale
of face, but with the familiar Talleyrand features fully
developed: the quiet blue-grey eyes, so very observant,
under bushy eye-brows, the nose pointed and slightly
turned up, the lower lip protruding a little, a faint smile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
hovering about the mouth, and a fine crop of long, wavy
hair framing the attractive face. He had taken a small
house in the district of Bellechasse (near the Invalides),
collected an excellent library of good books in good
bindings, and at once renewed his acquaintance with
Choiseul, Count Louis de Narbonne, and the Abbé de
Périgord. They were collective owners of a stable of
racers, and were the nucleus of a group of diners and
talkers that nearly every ambitious woman must entertain.
Talleyrand soon completed his education. He
became a famous whist-player (his chief amusement
through life), and added a good deal to his income at
the tables.</p>

<p>He had in the Rue Saint-Dominique an interesting
and useful neighbour in the Countess de Genlis. After
a very romantic career she was then in charge of the
children of the Duc de Chartres. In 1779 she had
retired from the gaiety (and orgies) of the Palais Royal
to train, on the best moral and philosophical principles,
the twin daughters of the Duchess. The Convent of
the Sisters of the Holy Sepulchre at Bellechasse was
a favourite spot for “retreats” amongst the wealthy
Parisians, and a house was built in its grounds in which
the retired countess could carry out her work. Over
its street door&mdash;a grilled, very religious-looking door&mdash;was
written, in gold characters, Addison’s excellent
saying: “True happiness is of a retired nature and an
enemy to pomp and noise.” Two of the nuns guarded
the door, which was firmly closed at ten every night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
and the key was taken into the convent. Inside, beyond
the simple furniture (she had left her seven hundred
pounds’ worth of mirrors in her salon at the Palais), all
was calmly educative. Busts of great and good men,
maps, historical tablets, &amp;c., abounded. So Mme. de
Genlis in her memoirs. She was just such a neighbour
as Talleyrand would appreciate at that time. With the
same ever-flowing pen she would write a most edifying
book on moral education, a Jacobin speech for the Duke,
and an erotic novel. Her moral writings testified, as
E. de Goncourt says, to “the ease with which her
imagination could find a substitute for experience.”
All Paris descended on the model teacher’s dwelling
in the Rue Saint-Dominique. There being a royal
princess (the infant) in the house men could enter the
enclosure; and, says Talleyrand, in one of his caustic
moments, she “always yielded at once so as to avoid
the scandal of coquetry.” Heavy gambling went on
under the Addisonian maxim. One youth lost 13,000
louis there. Talleyrand was a very frequent visitor,
and an assiduous observer. “When you see much of
men,” said his cynical friend, Chamfort, “your heart
must break or bronze.” Talleyrand was not afflicted
with a tender heart. His own house at Bellechasse
soon became the centre of a brilliant circle of talkers.
Though he rarely went to bed before three or four he
was up early, and was joined by his friends over a cup
of chocolate. He had a peculiarity in the heart-beat,
to which he attributed his power of dispensing with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>sleep. He ate little&mdash;a cup of chocolate or a biscuit
and glass of Madeira during the day, and a choice
dinner in the evening. But his wine, his coffee, and
his cook were carefully chosen, his toilet elaborately
neat. One of the most cultured groups in the city
used to gather at his house in the morning. Choiseul
was the best of the group, and it is gratifying to find
Talleyrand speaking of him in the later days with real
affection. He was an animated talker and a good
scholar, but he departed presently for the Embassy at
Constantinople. Few of the others are spared in the
terrible memoirs. He might have said with Chamfort,
if he had deigned to borrow a phrase: “I have friends
who love me, friends who don’t care a pin about me, and
friends who detest me.” But their daily talks were one
of the events of Parisian life. Most of them were, or
became, Academicians. There was the boisterous young
colonel, Count Louis de Narbonne, the third of the
trinity, a hard military student, but jovial in company
beyond the limit of taste. There was Colonel Lauzun
(later Duc de Biron), who had begun his gallant
adventures at seventeen, and contracted a debt of a
million and a half by his thirty-fourth year; who often
shot with the King, and boasted of the affection of the
Queen. Later (when he came out of his third prison)
there was young Mirabeau, “the tribune of the people,”
with the huge, pock-marked face, and the sonorous
denunciation of the social order that persecuted him.
Of older men, there were the Abbé Delille, the chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
poet of the time, friend of Voltaire, an <i>abbé commendataire</i>
(30,000 livres) with “the face of an infant,”
the pen of a libertine, and the ideas of a philosopher:
Chamfort, of the “electric head” (it bristled so with
ideas), living now with the widow of Helvétius, pouring
out vitriolic doses on humanity in all its aspects, but
secretly writing Mirabeau’s and Talleyrand’s elevated
democratic speeches&mdash;“How many fools does it take to
make a public?” he used to ask: Count Lauraguais,
very cultured and a generous patron of science and
letters: Panchaud, the Swiss banker, greatly esteemed
by Talleyrand, “the only man in France who could
make the goose with the golden eggs lay without
cutting its guts out,” said Mirabeau: Barthez, the
doctor-philosopher, editor of the <i>Encyclopædia</i>: Ruehière,
the young historian of Russia: Dupont de Nemours,
the famous young economist.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="caption">MADAME DE GENLIS.</p></div>


<p>Conversation would not lack variety or brilliance
amongst such a group. Talleyrand’s assemblies began
to be talked about. He was invited “more or less
everywhere,” and went. He was already sufficiently
detached from the idea of partisanship to find his way
about amongst the conflicting salons. The houses of
twenty noble dames were the centre for as many parties&mdash;of
the King, of the Queen, of d’Artois, of the Duc
d’Orléans, of Turgot, and Choiseul, and Necker, and de
Rohan, and de Brienne, and so on. Talleyrand overlooked
their political differences, except for a tactical
opposition to Necker, and enjoyed their graceful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
friendship and influence. He went to the Palais Royal,
where the Duc de Chartres (later d’Orléans, and finally
Egalité) was wearing out his useless life&mdash;“his vices,”
says Talleyrand, in one of those phrases that were
gaining him respect, or at least neutrality, “his vices
knew no bounds but the limit of his imagination and
that of those about him.” Those about him had not
infertile imaginations. Talleyrand was taken by Archbishops
Dillon, de Brienne, and Cicé, to the house of
Mme. de Montesson (secretly married to the Duc
d’Orléans), and was granted a seat in the box reserved
for “more or less dissipated clerics” (his own phrase) in
the private opera-house where Madame and the Duke
and other noble amateurs performed. He found her
house “at the furthest limit of decency, but very
pleasant.” It is the only place at which he speaks of
meeting his spiritual leaders. Loménie de Brienne had
been proposed to the King for the archbishopric of
Paris. “But surely,” said Louis, “the archbishop of
Paris should be a man who believes in God.” It did
not seem to matter at Toulouse. He went also to the
Hotel de Rohan, where the adventurer, Cagliostro, with
the olive complexion and brilliant eyes, was exhibiting
the devil to people who did not believe in God. At
Mme. de Montesson’s he one early day made a feeble
joke to the Duchess de Gramont, the sister of Choiseul,
and several doors were immediately opened to him.
Once a week he took his own brilliant group to dinner
at the house of Mme. d’Héricourt. The Swedish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
minister instituted another day for them, but the dinner
was killed by forcing the talkers to listen to long
readings&mdash;the craze of the hour. Another house he
visited, at Auteuil, was that of the Countess de
Boufflers-Rouvrel; and at the house of her next-door
neighbour, Mme. Helvétius, he would find Chamfort at
home, with the Abbé Sieyès, the later constitution
maker, and Cabanis, the materialist.</p>

<p>The only house which he visited with any particular
freedom, besides that of his mother and that of Mme. de
Genlis, was that of the Countess de Flahaut, at the
Louvre. Governor Morris, the American Envoy, affirms
that he found Talleyrand helping to give her a foot-bath
there one morning. Her son, born in 1785, was
pretty generally accredited to Talleyrand, but in an age
of myths and scandals exact determination is as difficult
as it is superfluous.</p>

<p>He shared the celebrated dinners of Mme. de
Reynière, saw the deistic Abbé Delille dine with the
Queen at Mme. de Polignac’s, and went to “learned and
tiresome concerts” at Mme. Lebrun’s (the artist),
M. d’Albaret’s, and the Count de la Rochechouart’s.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that he was merely
tolerated in these circles. He was sought and esteemed.
It is said that he was generally one of the last to enter
a salon, limping slightly, faultlessly dressed in blue coat
and white vest and chamois breeches (unless it were
advisable to remember the soutane), and there was an
appreciable movement towards him. His biting wit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
and quick repartee soon forced people to reckon with
him. One never knew when his deep, deliberate voice
would break in with effect. “I don’t know why people
don’t like me,” one man was saying; “I have only
done one wrong thing in my life.” “When will it be
over?” asked Talleyrand. “Sieyès is deep,” said
another to him. “You mean hollow,” he at once
replied. A lady once asked him, in a period of difficulty,
how his affairs were going. One version has it that she
asked how his legs were. “As you see, madame,” he
suavely answered. The lady squinted. His liberal
ideas were, of course, an advantage. “He dresses like
a fop, thinks like a deist, and preaches like an angel,”
said someone; though we have no trace whatever of his
ever delivering sermons. But it was the age of the
philosophers. Talleyrand disliked the more consistent
and more advanced of them, such as Condillac, Hélvetius,
d’Holbach, and the Abbé Raynal, because they not only
destroyed superstition, but “broke the links of the
moral and social order”&mdash;such as it was. But this
was written twenty years afterwards. He was never
caught by the charlatanry of Jean-Jacques. He greatly
esteemed Voltaire, and took care to be presented to
him when he came to Paris and was fêted to death in
1778. The myth-makers of later years describe how
he went on his knees for the aged philosopher’s
blessing.</p>

<p>I will only add, to complete Talleyrand’s environment
about this time, that he had relations also with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
most of the retired statesmen of the day, Maurepas,
Malesherbes, Choiseul and Turgot, and with the chief
scientific workers, La Place, Condorcet, Lagrange,
Monge, &amp;c. Of this I will say more presently.
Enough has been said to elucidate the progress of
Talleyrand’s character up to the time of the Revolution.
The work which I have to describe in the next chapter
will prevent one from thinking that his time was wholly
spent in pleasure or devoted to the task of social
advancement. From 1780 onwards he was a most
assiduous worker, and must have been an industrious
student before that time. But he tasted, at least, every
part of the life of Paris in those ten years at Bellechasse.
I do not mean that he devoured all that it offered. He
was an essentially temperate and refined man. He
played for heavy stakes, as most people did; there were
some 4,000 gambling houses at Paris when the
Revolution began, to say nothing of salons, from that of
the Queen at Marly downwards. But this is the only
irregularity he admits; though, of course, the
“Memoirs” are not “Confessions.” The Baron de
Vars has compiled a work on <i>Les femmes de Talleyrand</i>.
There is only one on the list, Mme. de Flahaut, besides
the pretty actress of Saint-Sulpice and the lady he
eventually married, with whom his name is connected
by any show of evidence. At the same time it would
be absurd to claim for him any prohibitive principles in
such matters. He took a mind almost swept of ideals
into a world where, one social writer says, you could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
count the families that were not stained with incest:
where, at all events, almost every man, from princes and
cardinals down to butchers and abbés, had a mistress.
He was no hypocrite. The Church and the world alike
expected too little of him for that.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Priest and Bishop</span></p>


<p>Talleyrand had already spent two years of this kind
of life when he was ordained priest. In a biographical
inquiry it is only necessary to point out that the
priesthood was required for his purpose. Possibly he
thought of his parents, as some biographers suggest.
However regrettable his life, he was a noble, and
must not remain a minor cleric. In any case, he
would see that the only entrance to the higher political
world, along the path into which he had been forced,
was the episcopate. He could not be expected to
foresee the upheaval of 1789, which would make
possible the rise of such men as Sieyès. In 1780 the
General Assembly of the Clergy would meet again, and
he had ground to believe that he would be appointed
Agent-General. From this important position one
usually passed to the episcopate. After such an
experience as his had been he would very well leave
it to the Church to settle its own credit in the
matter.</p>

<p>In September (1779) he asked his uncle, in a
letter which is extant, to receive him into the Rheims
clergy. The Archbishop of Paris was a conscientious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
prelate, where it was still possible to consult conscience.
Archbishop Talleyrand (he had succeeded Roche-Aymon
in 1777) consented and obtained his transfer from
Paris. He, too, was one of the better prelates of the
time, but he doubtless thought he could influence his
gay nephew. He was transferred on September 17th
and ordained deacon. Three months later (December
18th) he was ordained priest in the chapel of the
archbishopric.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> Choiseul was with him, and made a
strong appeal to him to desist. He said it was
impossible. All that we shall learn of Talleyrand in
the chapters to come justifies us in thinking&mdash;nay,
compels us to think&mdash;that he took the step, not with
a cynical levity, but with great reluctance. The qualities
of refinement and humanity he never surrendered.</p>

<p>On May 10th, 1780, he was nominated by the
clergy of Tours (where he now had a second chaplaincy)
Agent-General for the next five years. This was a
position of the first political importance in the French
Church. The Agent-General was the connecting link
between the two powers, secular and ecclesiastical, and
by the end of the eighteenth century he needed some
competence in diplomacy, as well as a fair administrative
faculty for domestic matters, especially of finance. Two
were appointed by the various provinces in rotation
before each General Assembly, and they held office and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>guarded the interests of the Church until the next
ordinary Assembly. If Talleyrand had, as <i>promoteur</i>
at the last Assembly, left the chief share of the work
to his colleague, the case was very different now. His
fellow-agent was the Abbé de Boisgelin, cousin of the
Archbishop of Aix, and Vicar-General of that diocese,
an indolent, incompetent, and disreputable priest. He
shared the fruits and prestige of Talleyrand’s labours,
but not the work itself. In fact Talleyrand says that
a scandal supervened immediately, and made it advisable
to keep him in the background.</p>

<p>These General Assemblies did not vary much in
their chief features, so that little need be said of that of
1780. Only two deputies (one of each order) were sent
from each of the provinces, and the Cardinal-Archbishop
of Rouen took the chair. The King now asked thirty
millions, and Talleyrand was directed to wait on him at
Versailles and say that his faithful clergy, though
“exhausted by its gifts,” would find the money; he
was to add a hint (with an eye to the increasing
attacks on the Church’s property) that the King would
doubtless see the wisdom of not killing the goose.
Talleyrand would not lose his opportunity at Versailles.
There were the usual indignant discussions of the claim
of the Crown lawyers to exact feudal service from the
clergy, and violent attacks on Voltaire and the “formidable
deluge” of improper literature that was poured
over the whole country. The Assembly sat from May
to October. Talleyrand was now so secure in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
position that he even claims that this “lent some
prestige to his Agency.”</p>

<p>Two years later he had to summon the clergy to an
Extraordinary Assembly at the Grands-Augustins. The
King’s letter which he had to submit to his colleagues
must have appealed to his diplomatic sense. Louis XVI
declared that, though there had been unforeseen losses
in connection with the help given to America, he had no
actual need to appeal to the country. But the fact was
that every class seemed so eager to contribute towards
covering these losses, and he could not think of
excluding his devoted clergy from a share. He
therefore graciously permitted them to assemble in
extraordinary session in 1782. Talleyrand was charged
to explain to the Assembly why the King had altered
his mind, and not kept the solemn promise that he
would ask no more money until 1785. The fifteen
millions were granted as usual, and the clergy added
a million to be applied to the relief of the poor
families who had suffered by the war. Talleyrand went
further, and pressed one of the prelates to urge the
granting permission to re-marry to the Breton women
whose husbands had disappeared without any definite
proof of death. He says that the prelate saw no
advantage to himself in making a motion, and so the
matter was not brought before the Assembly. Bad
books occupied more attention than ever. A complete
edition of Voltaire was being printed at Kehl, and was
expected at Paris with the most open rejoicing. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
deputies drew the King’s attention to its “monstrous
obscenities,” and petitioned him to prevent its circulation.
Talleyrand had not to sign this petition, but he
saw Loménie de Brienne and many another Voltairean
pastor do so.</p>

<p>In this Assembly Talleyrand himself made two
proposals of an interesting character. The first was
that the clergy should buy up the royal lottery, by
making the King a “gratuitous gift” every year to
cover the profits missed. His colleagues were not
sufficiently moved by his eloquent denunciation of
public gambling to make the sacrifice. Some of them,
who knew the Abbé de Périgord’s own habits, may have
even smiled. But Talleyrand’s aim was good, if not
virtuous. He saw that the clergy were rapidly losing
ground, and he felt that a sacrifice like this, in such
a cause, would do much to redeem their degradation.
The memoir to present to the King (and, of course,
publish afterwards) “might have been superb,” he
observes with a chuckle; he would have been very
glad to write it. The other proposal he made was to
raise the salaries of the lower clergy. On these fell
the real work of maintaining religion in the country,
yet the <i>curé</i> had only 700 livres (less than thirty
pounds) a year and his <i>vicaire</i> the miserable sum of 350
livres. The episcopate was, like the army commissions,
a preserve of the nobles, and a great gulf yawned
between the two Orders. I calculate that the 140
bishops of France then drew about 8,000,000 francs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
a year from ecclesiastical sources alone; and as all were
nobles, many of them had in addition huge private
incomes and some State emoluments. Dillon had
160,000 a year from the Queen’s private purse for his
amiability. They drove about Paris in gilded coaches,
contributed to the opera, had opulent hotels and
country palaces and hunting seats, and so on. The
starving peasantry were beginning to rebel. At the
Assembly of Notables the Archbishop of Aix spoke of
tithe as “that voluntary offering from the piety of the
faithful”; “as to which,” broke in the Duke de la
Rochefoucauld, “there are now 40,000 cases on in
the Courts.” The lower clergy, too, were forming
associations for the betterment of their condition. The
prelates heard this with pained surprise, but resisted
Talleyrand’s motion. His earliest political efforts, as
he said afterwards, failed because his proposals were
too bold for his colleagues. But there can be no
question as to the wisdom of his counsels. No one
could at that time have had even the dimmest prevision
of the events of 1789-1790&mdash;and so we may at once
reject Pozzo di Borgo’s suggestion (afterwards) that
Talleyrand from the first took the side of the weak
and poor on subtle calculation&mdash;but Talleyrand’s view
of the situation of the Church was singularly wise and
shrewd, and his suggestions were, as we now very
clearly see, wholly to its advantage. Nor can we
with justice ignore the clear strain of humanity that
is seen in the young abbé’s proposals in favour of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
Breton widows (whom he had seen in their native home)
and the lower clergy. In the latter instance he was
even endangering his interest with the prelates.</p>

<p>Talleyrand’s labours as Agent-General had the effect
that he desired. If the Church would not listen to wise
advice it must go its way. For him its work was an
instrument, and he used it with success. His various
reports on their labours to the Conseil du Roi brought
him in contact with his real fellows. Before his Agency
was over he had won the notice and esteem of the first
minister. But I will conclude this account of his clerical
work before tracing his earliest political action. The
clergy greatly appreciated his ability. At the Assembly
of 1785 he was elected secretary, with the Abbé de
Dillon, and one day the president rose, after a speech
from Talleyrand, to exhibit him to his colleagues as a
model of zeal! The report of their Agency which he
and Boisgelin sent in was received with enthusiasm, and
described as taking “a distinguished place amongst the
reports which adorn our annals.” Talleyrand neglected
nothing in those early years. His work was sound and
thorough, and at the same time presented with a rare
literary effect. The mythopæic biographers of a later date<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>had private knowledge that he was too lazy and too
incompetent to write a single letter, and that everything
was done for him by his associates. We know
that from 1780 onwards he attracted to his help a
number of capable men, M. Mannay, Count Bourlier,
M. Duvoisin (these three reaching their reward in
bishoprics), and especially the young Abbé des Renaudes.
He could not have done his work so well single-handed,
and, as a fact, he quite early learned from Choiseul the
rule to utilise subordinates to the fullest extent. It was
good statesmanship. But it is quite clear that he must
have worked hard. Thirty years afterwards, long after
he has exchanged financial politics for diplomacy, he
writes with the pleasure and ease of an expert on the
financial questions of 1780-1790. There is no doubt
that he thoroughly understood them, and discussed them
on equal terms with Panchaud, Foulon, or Dupont de
Nemours. And the memoirs themselves show that he
could write; he was often seen to sit writing them until
four in the morning. Sainte-Beuve himself admits
(p. 44) that Talleyrand could do some “fine writing”
when he cared.</p>

<p>The report he submitted in 1785 was to be his
last plea for a bishopric. It was the custom to find a
benefice as a reward for the Agent-General when his
term was over. Talleyrand, therefore, wrote it with
great care and with plenty of that flattery which his
colleagues appreciated. How he felt when he spoke
of “the honour of being associated with the labours of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
the first body in the kingdom, the happy necessity of
communicating with the chief members of this illustrious
body, and of maintaining with them relations
which their virtues and their intelligence have made
so precious,” we can very well imagine. One only
wonders if he caught the eye of his friends of the Palais
Royal when he referred to the Archbishop-President,
Dillon, as a man “to whom all offices have been but
fresh occasions to display the nobleness of his character
and the vigour of his patriotic genius.” Dillon is the
prelate who, he tells us elsewhere, spent six months
every year in hunting, though he had done some good
work. In return the archbishop urgently recommended
the ex-agents to the favour of the King and of Mgr.
Marb&oelig;uf (who held the <i>feuille des bénéfices</i>, or list of
vacant bishoprics). The assembly then voted, as was
usual, a gift of 24,000 livres to each ex-agent, and
further sums of 4,000 and 3,000 for having discharged
the functions of promoter and secretary. But the
recommendation for a bishopric fell very flat, to Talleyrand’s
extreme annoyance. The most brilliant Agent-General
of recent times was made to wait three years
for his reward, and saw one bishopric after another fall
to others. It is said that the king was resolutely
opposed to the consecration of so equivocal a candidate,
but we have no real evidence of this. Talleyrand complained,
in a letter to young Choiseul, of malice on the
part of Marb&oelig;uf, but it is possible that the circumstance
of Marb&oelig;uf being a religious man with some firmness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>may afford explanation enough. Talleyrand’s name was
persistently connected with that of Madame de Flahaut,
and at one time with that of the daughter-in-law of Buffon.
There was a good deal of joking about the prospect of
his consecration. Chamfort and a group of amiable
ladies were marked out as ready to accompany him to
his seat. It is not impossible that Versailles drew the
line&mdash;when it felt strong enough.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="caption">MARIE ANTOINETTE.</p></div>

<p>Another feature of the situation was that he had
incurred the hostility of the Queen, and she robbed him
of a cardinal’s hat in that very year; though the hat
might have been very much in the way in 1791. The
Countess de Brionne persuaded the King of Sweden to
ask the Pope for a hat for the Abbé de Périgord. The
Pope, who at that time was friendly with the Protestant
prince, agreed, and the matter was nearly arranged when
the diamond-necklace affair happened. Mme. de
Brionnne sided with de Rohan, and Talleyrand followed.
The Queen took a small revenge by getting the Austrian
Ambassador to protest against another hat being sent to
France, and Talleyrand was disappointed. Later, when
the archbishopric of Bourges fell vacant, and he was passed
over, Talleyrand complained bitterly to his friend
Choiseul. It was not until the end of 1788, that he
became Bishop of Autun.</p>

<p>In the meantime Talleyrand had opened his political
career on other than ecclesiastical questions. I have
already said that, whilst he lived at Bellechasse, he
visited not only fashionable ladies, savants and artists,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
but also some of the great statesmen of the last generation.
He met Maurepas, a typical representative of the
decaying order, Malesherbes, the great parliamentarian
and liberal reformer, and Turgot. As Maurepas and
Turgot died in 1781, he must have given serious
attention to political matters as soon as, or even before,
he left the Sorbonne. With the elder Choiseul in his
retirement he would be more closely connected through
his intimacy with the nephew. The outbreak of the
American war and the departure of a number of young
French nobles, had done even more than the prospect
of national bankruptcy to arouse political interest.
Franklin’s house at Passy was besieged by fair enthusiasts,
eager to embrace him; his fur cap was copied by every
dandy in Paris, and constitutional problems were
discussed by young ladies in the intervals of a dance.
“The zeal for America is simply sublime,” says Michelet;
while Alison has opined that “the American war was
the great change which blew into a flame the embers of
innovation.” The philosophical party certainly tried to
give it that character. When Lafayette and his nobles
returned with an account of the glorious new constitution
and democracy, the concrete instance led to a more
general discussion, which was boldly, though in a limited
extent (for there were no republicans yet to speak of)
applied to France. Talleyrand was not carried away in
the flood. He did fit out a privateer with his friend
Choiseul, begging a few guns from the Ministry of
Marine; but he ridiculed the general enthusiasm. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
next fashion was Anglo-mania, and this in turn raised
constitutional questions of interest to France.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>It is clear that, from an early stage of his attention
to the questions raised in the salons and circles by these
episodes, Talleyrand was prepared for popular representation,
and was disposed to favour the English model.
His manifesto, issued on the eve of the States-General,
will show us that he did not wait for the logic of events
to make him embrace democracy, but there are earlier
indications. During the Assembly of the Notables in
1787 he complained to Choiseul that “Paris was taking
its cue from the Assembly instead of an instructed
Paris impressing its opinion on the Assembly;” and
in the same letter he observed with satisfaction that
“the people were going to count for something,” and
that “the granting of provincial administration [local
self-government] and the abolition of privileges would
prove a source of great gain.” The tragic incompetency
of the King and Queen to master the situation of their
country impressed him. Mere “goodness of heart”
was fatal. “Too great a familiarity in sovereigns,” he
says in his memoirs, “inspires love rather than respect,
and at the first mishap affection goes.” It was the
opinion of a man in whom (to turn his own words
upon himself) “philosophic ideas had replaced sentiments,”
but it expresses the facts here. The network
of noble and ecclesiastical privileges made aristocracy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>impossible in an impoverished country. The choice
was between a strong autocrat (whom the gods gave
when they willed) and a monarchy limited by an
educated democracy. With Montesquieu he leaned to
the latter; the satirical description of France as “an
autocracy tempered with lampoons” is attributed to
him. With Turgot he felt that the people must be
educated up to self-government. He pleaded strongly
for more efficient and more comprehensive education.
A contemporary gives this as his fad. He travelled in
privileged provinces like Brittany, and noted the good
result of local administration. He would hardly admit
moral feeling in the matter, but as a practical politician
he was for gradual and constitutional, but thorough,
reform.</p>

<p>But the central question of French politics to every
thoughtful man was that of finance. He saw nobles
coquetting with democracy who were not prepared to
surrender a tithe of those pecuniary privileges which
were strangling the actual order. He saw constitutionalists
working out their “theory of irregular verbs”
without even a moderate grasp of the crucial need. He
immediately set himself to master the science of finance
and the fiscal disorders of his country. His archiepiscopal
friends were well acquainted with the one,
and such friends as Panchaud and Dupont de Nemours
would help him with both. His first open political
expression was a vehement attack on Necker after his
assumption of power in 1776. There was a good deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
of <i>parti pris</i> in his first attack. He ridiculed the person,
the features, the dress, the speech, and everything about
Necker, as well as his financial operations. But he did
oppose on conviction the tactics of the Genevese banker.
He thought them too slow, too timid, too small-minded
to rescue France from the precipice. At last
he made an opportunity for a constructive effort. The
funds of the clergy were interested in the bank founded
by Turgot, and when anxiety arose about this in 1784
he forced his position as Agent-General (so he himself
says), and drew up a memoir in which he proposed a
reconstruction of the bank. The memoir attracted
much attention. One elderly banker listened to it
almost with tears&mdash;at the pretty way in which he put
banking common-places, Talleyrand says. A number
of experts became acquainted with him&mdash;Foulon, Sainte-Foy,
Daudé, &amp;c. Presently he was introduced to
Calonne, the new Minister of Finance, a man of great
ability but fitful and unscrupulous.</p>

<p>Calonne’s failure is a matter of general history, but
during the three years of his ministry Talleyrand was
usefully associated with him. The stormy Mirabeau
also appears on the scene, and alternately embraces and
quarrels with Talleyrand. His dispatches from Berlin,
where he acted as a kind of secret agent, were nearly
all edited by Talleyrand before being submitted to the
King. He addresses Talleyrand from Berlin as his
“dear master,” but has a violent quarrel with him, and
calls him “a wretched, mean, greedy, intriguing creature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>”
when he returns to Paris, on account of some offensive
allusion to his mistress. Talleyrand overlooked his
violence and vulgarity, and intervened for him when
he published one of his spirited attacks on Calonne.
But Talleyrand’s next important act was to help in
preparing a scheme for the redemption of the debt of
the clergy. Calonne had thought of parrying the
growing demand for the convocation of the States-General
by summoning an Assembly of Notables. Talleyrand
speaks of his scheme as “a vast plan,” but without base,
as the Notables had no power whatever to raise the
necessary supplies. However, it afforded him an
opportunity to do helpful work. The Assembly was
to meet on February 22nd (1787), and on the 14th
Calonne invited Talleyrand,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> Dupont de Nemours, and
several others to come to assist him in preparing the
papers to be submitted. They found a chaos of material,
and none of the work done. They divided the work,
Talleyrand undertaking to write the memoir and law on
the new grain-proposals. He also helped M. de Saint-Genis
to draw up a scheme for the redemption of the
debt of the clergy. This was to be part of Calonne’s
plan of a general land-tax and the abolition of all
pecuniary privileges.</p>

<p>Calonne’s expedient, as is known, only brought
about his own downfall. Talleyrand, in Paris, met
these angry notables as they filled the salons during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>Easter recess, and heard their comments on the impertinence
of the <i>subvention territoriale</i>, by which they,
the nobles and clergy, were to be mulcted. Loménie
de Brienne fostered the opposition amongst the clergy.
Calonne was dismissed, and, after an interval of
nonentities, the Archbishop of Toulouse secured the
long-coveted honour, chiefly through the influence of
the Queen. Talleyrand would expect few favours from
de Brienne (of whom he writes in the memoirs with
disdain and dislike) and the Queen’s party. He felt that
the near future would smooth out their intrigue. “The
passion of the hour was the curtailment of the royal
authority,” he says. The King was pitied and the Queen
regarded with cold suspicion. The enormous deficit
dismayed thoughtful men, whilst frivolous nobles called
airily for a declaration of national bankruptcy as a means
of salvation they had themselves tried with success. The
letters which Talleyrand then wrote to his friend at
Constantinople show that his observations in the
memoirs faithfully convey the ideas he had at the
time. Certain technical improvements in finance would
do something, but it was clear that the situation of the
nobility and clergy must change. The life-blood of
France was being sucked for the support of a parasitic
growth. Financial privileges must be curtailed or
abolished. Who would cut away the exhausting growth
of commissions, sinecures, benefices, and gifts? Clearly,
neither the nobles themselves nor the King. The
country must be prepared for popular representation on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
the English model&mdash;as seen through the merciful mists
of the Channel. Talleyrand proceeded with interest to
the Provincial Assembly at Chalons, to which he was
deputed as abbé of St. Denis at Rheims.</p>

<p>The Provincial Assembly was a compromise with
the new idea of popular representation. Six members
of the clerical order and six of the nobility were pitted
against twelve of the Third Estate; equal representation
for the sansculottist twenty millions against the privileged
two hundred thousand. And the president was to be
chosen from the first two orders. These twenty-five
nominated twenty-four other members, and one-fourth of
the Assembly was to retire every year. At the elections
to replace them everyone who paid ten livres in taxes
was entitled to vote. Archbishop Talleyrand presided at
Chalons, and must have gratified his nephew and the Third
Estate at least by his outspoken denunciation of “greed”
and his welcome of the promised reform of taxation.
The work of these Assemblies was presently transferred
to Versailles, in the opening of the States-General, and
it need not be dwelt on. Talleyrand is believed to be
the author of two long memoranda, submitted to the
Chalons Assembly, on points relating to taxation. He
was confirmed in his opinion of the value of these
schools of popular training, for we find him urging the
reopening of them in the National Assembly in 1789.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="caption">LOUIS XVI.</p></div>

<p>But his entry into political life was now properly
regulated by his nomination to a bishopric. He had
gone to Rheims as Vicar-General to his uncle, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>Mgr. Marb&oelig;uf, who is believed to have so long opposed
his promotion, was transferred from the See of Autun,
and it was offered to Talleyrand. There are legends
enough to explain how the King suddenly acquired his
conviction of the “piety” of the Abbé de Périgord.
The most probable story is that Talleyrand’s father, who
died in 1788, begged Louis to confer the lingering
bishopric on his son. Lieutenant-General Talleyrand
had been an attendant on the King in his early years, and
was a useful officer and a religious man. He would
regard the long delay in finding a benefice for his son as
a disgrace to one of the oldest houses in France.
At all events, on November 2nd, the King signed the
nomination, informing an amused Paris that he was
“properly assured as to the good life, the morals, the
piety, the competence, and all the other virtuous and
commendable qualities of the Abbé de Périgord.” Paris
remembered that a former Bishop of Autun had been the
original of Tartuffe. “Ah, if Molière had only known
his successor,” said one wag at the time. There were
many religious and high-minded prelates amongst the
French hierarchy, and they commanded a priesthood of
considerable self-sacrifice and devotion. But Talleyrand’s
opinions and habits would not cause a grave shock to a
body that included Cardinal de Rohan, Archbishops
Dillon, De Brienne and Cicé, and a considerable body of
bishops and abbé’s of the type of de Grimaldi, Morellet,
Arnaud, Bertrand, Delille, de Bourbon, de Dillon,
Raynal, Maury, Sabatier, &amp;c.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">AT THE STATES-GENERAL</span></p>


<p>Talleyrand was consecrated in the seminary-chapel at
Issy, a house of retreat belonging to Saint-Sulpice, on
January 16th, 1788. He had observed, in that age of
forms, the form of making a preliminary retreat at Issy.
His delighted friends from Paris took care that the
“solitude,” as the place was called, should not depress
him. The ceremony was performed by the Bishop-Count
of Noyon, Mgr. de Grimaldi, a Voltairean prelate.
There are two legendary versions of Talleyrand’s bearing
during the service. Renan was told by an aged priest
who had been present that he was so scandalised at the
jauntiness of the new prelate as to feel compelled to
charge himself with disrespectful thoughts at his next
confession. Another version affirms that Talleyrand
fainted from some emotion or other during the morning.
It is more likely that Talleyrand bore himself with
perfect propriety and indifference. Liberal nobles and
prelates rarely ridiculed religion even in private conversation.
“I have always moved in good society,” said
one at a later date, when asked if he had ever scoffed at
sacred things. Talleyrand would regard his share in the
ceremony as a regrettable necessity of his political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
career. It deceived nobody. In the evening he
returned to Paris, and received the pallium (a privilege
of the Autun bishopric) from the archbishop.</p>

<p>With the sonorous title of “Bishop of Autun, First
Suffragan of the Archbishop of Lyons, Administrator of
of the Temporalities and Spiritualities of the said Archbishopric,
<i>sede vacante</i>, Perpetual President of the States
of Burgundy, Count of Sanlien, Baron of Issy-l’Evéque,
Lucenay, Grosme, Touillon, &amp;c.,” he was now somewhat
better equipped for political work. The See of Autun
was one of the most ancient in France, though its income
was relatively very small&mdash;22,000 livres a year. It was,
however, regarded as having next claim to the Archbishopric
of Lyons, and the King had already bestowed
a second abbey (of Celles, with 9,500 livres a year) on
Talleyrand, and I find assigned to him in a list published
at Paris in 1790, the rich Abbey of Bec. He was able
to resume his pleasant ways at Paris, with an income of
about 100,000 livres, and the credit of a rising prelate. It
is probably to this period that the story of his adventure
with the coach builder belongs. Receiving no answer
to his applications for payment for the new episcopal
carriage, the maker presented himself, hat in hand, at
Talleyrand’s door when Monseigneur come out. After
a few days of this Talleyrand blandly asked him what he
wanted. “Oh, you will be paid,” he affably replied to
the man. “But <i>when</i>, Monseigneur?” “Oh, you are
very inquisitive,” said the prelate with an appearance of
astonishment, as he drove away. It was the golden age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
of debtors. The King once ventured to tell Archbishop
Dillon that he had heard he was greatly in debt. “I
will consult my steward and report to your Majesty,”
said the prelate.</p>

<p>On the other hand Talleyrand found that he must
at length resort to actual duplicity to strengthen his
position at Autun. The diocese of Mgr. Marb&oelig;uf
was likely to hear of the new appointment with some
misgiving. But already there were rumours of States-General,
and it was necessary to secure real influence at
Autun. Within a fortnight Talleyrand issued&mdash;let us
hope he did not write&mdash;a letter to his flock, which
closed the mouths of the pious grumblers. It was full
of Scripture and redolent of a quiet, unmistakeable
fervour and simplicity. “God is my witness,” it says,
in the words of St. Paul, “that I am mindful of you
without interruption.” He praises the zeal of his
clergy, alludes to those unhappy people who “only seek
in offices the miserable gratification of their vanity,” and
urgently asks their prayers for his comfort. It was read
to tearful congregations in all the churches of his diocese
the next Sunday&mdash;Talleyrand being detained in Paris.
A few weeks later his useful secretary, the Abbé des
Renandes, was offered the Vicar-Generalship by the
canons. He would not fail to follow up the effect of
the letter he had (probably) written. On January 27th
Talleyrand took possession of his cathedral, by representative.
Important events were preparing at Paris
and Versailles. A great arena for political adventure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
was being opened. About the middle of March he was
free to follow the impulse of his heart and visit his
beloved sheep; he had in his pocket the order to
convoke the preliminary assembly of the clergy which
was to send him to the States-General at Versailles.</p>

<p>This is really the most unpleasant page in
Talleyrand’s life. I am glad the writing of it is over.
But there is&mdash;perhaps unhappily&mdash;no mystery about
it. He was carrying to logical conclusions the cynical
estimate of the ecclesiastical order which his experiences
had forced on him.</p>

<p>On Sunday, March 15th, he took solemn possession
of his cathedral, and was honoured with a great
fête. He took the oath, so often recalled by his
enemies afterwards, to defend all the rights and
privileges and the property of his church. He remained
a month at Autun and captivated everybody. Were
there rumours of Voltairean opinions and loose
practices? He said his breviary daily in the garden&mdash;as
anyone could see&mdash;attended to every function of
his office, presided at the episcopal council, was a model
bishop. Meantime his young abbé-assistants from Paris
were circulating in the diocese, their conversation always
ending with politics. There was open table at the
episcopal palace for the poor curés, and the reputation
of some of his Lenten dishes flew from parish to parish.
The townspeople were badly supplied with fish, and a
word to friends at Versailles got the post to stop at
Autun and drop a load of fresh fish daily for the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
market. The religious congregations were amiably
cultivated, and became zealous for Monseigneur’s
candidature. Soon there are 209 ecclesiastical electors
assembled at Autun, many of them rough, hard-working
curés, who distrust this descendant of all the Périgords.
Monseigneur is tactful, candid, democratic; quietly
leads their meetings as honorary president. He finds
that the only serious rivals are Radical curés, with cries
of “Down with the aristocrats in Church and State,” and
better salaries for the “working clergy.” Then he
issues his manifesto.</p>

<p>Sainte-Beuve was forced to say after reading it
that Talleyrand “showed from the first day that he was
one of the most enlightened and most penetrating minds
of the time.” It met every serious grievance on which
his rivals depended, and it was perfectly sincere.
Talleyrand was not embittered against his order, like
Mirabeau, by his experiences, nor did he lean to
democratic principles on the lines of the Duc d’Orléans.
He formed a sober and consistent judgment on the social
and political situation, and it does no less credit to his
humanity than his sagacity. He would claim at the
States-General that that body should not be arbitrarily
interfered with or prematurely dispersed. He would
press for the making of a constitution as its first achievement;
and, for all Carlyle’s raillery, this was the first
political need of France. In this new constitution the
rights of the people must be recognised as well as those
of the king. The new political structure must have its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
first elements in the parish, and so up through Provincial
Assemblies to a permanent States-General. All
elections shall be free. The sanctity of private or
corporate property shall be respected, but only after
claims have been judicially examined and unsound
claims rejected; in this he is clearly foreshadowing his
attitude towards Church property. The administration
of justice shall be simplified and purified; the criminal
law reformed, lotteries suppressed, privileges abolished.
The press shall be free, and the post shall not be
interfered with. Feudal servitude shall be abolished.
There shall be a strict inquiry into the financial situation,
a reduction of expenditure, and the abolition of
pecuniary privileges.</p>

<p>I repeat that this was not a rhetorical and insincere
document, written for the purpose of catching votes.
There is, in the first place, no rhetoric about it. It is
a plain and sober statement of remedies for the national
malady. Then, it is quite in accord with the few
previous expressions of Talleyrand’s mind; and it is
a faithful presentment of the measures he proposed or
supported unequivocally afterwards at the National
Assembly. To appreciate it fully, we must, as
Mr. Belloc strongly pleads, beware of reading the ideas
of ’91 and ’92 into ’89. Camille Desmoulins said there
were not ten Republicans in France at that time. There
were demands for reform on every point that Talleyrand
takes up. I do not claim originality in the details,
but the manifesto, as a whole, is an unanswerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
refutation of those who would see nothing but frivolity,
selfishness and cynicism in its author. His experiences
had made him almost incapable of a zeal for an abstract
ideal of justice, but his sympathy and humanity, as well
as his political sagacity, gave a serious strain to his work.
He was elected deputy by a large majority, and his
address, with a few additions, was adopted by his clergy
as their <i>cahier</i> or book of instructions to their representative.</p>

<p>But from the moment of his election he ceased
to be an ecclesiastic, as far as possible. He left for Paris
on Easter Sunday, not waiting to officiate at the services
or to follow the retreat of the clergy which was
commencing. His parishioners never saw him again;
except that, thirteen years afterwards, his carriage broke
down at Autun, as he passed through on the way to
Lyons, and he is said to have been rather roughly
noticed.</p>

<p>The next fortnight was spent in feverish debate
at Paris on the forthcoming meeting. At the Thirty
Club, where cultured Radicals foregathered, and where
Talleyrand and Mirabeau had met the boldest politicians
of their class during the last year or two, the interest
was deep. Lafayette, Roederer, the Dukes de Luynes
and Larochefoucauld, Sabatier, and other Liberals
belonged to it, as well as some of Talleyrand’s earlier
friends. A new salon that he frequented, and that
rang with political controversy, was that of Mme. de
Staël. Necker’s daughter had married the Swedish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
Minister in 1786, and she succeeded in drawing
Talleyrand into her social circle. In such a circle
the dangers and possibilities of the coming meeting
were properly appreciated. These men, resolutely bent
on anticipating instead of waiting for events, like the
bulk of the nobles and the King’s party, saw clearly
enough that the great question was: Will the voting
be by orders separately or in common? The country
had been agitated over the question what proportion of
delegates should be allowed to the Third Estate. The
King had granted them a representation equal to that of
the first two orders together, or 600 members. But
the effect of this was inappreciable until the procedure
of voting had been settled; and this had been left
undecided. No one, indeed, approached the date with
the feeling of solemnity with which we now look
back on it through the smoke of the revolutionary
fires. But the situation was serious for men who, like
Talleyrand, were bent on making the national parliament
a reality. If the orders were to vote separately, the
machine would produce nothing; if together, the Third
Estate would be supported by the democratic curés and
would rule the Assembly.</p>

<p>And were the people prepared for this power?
Talleyrand must have stopped many a time in the gardens
of the Palais Royal, now the agora of Paris, and listened
to the barrel-oratory before the cafés. Men who had
been seen washing their only shirt in the Seine a
few months ago are leading crowds. Pamphlets are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
poured out by the thousand. The Duc d’Orléans is
fanning the flames that break out here and there.
Mirabeau is thundering. Sieyès is giving substance to
the quips of Chamfort. Grim, gaunt, ragged crowds
flood the street at the slightest provocation, sack
merchants’ houses, and attack the troops. Talleyrand
goes to Versailles in thoughtful mood. Popular representation
on the English plan, with a second house, is
the only hope.</p>

<p>Arnault describes in his <i>Souvenirs</i> how he saw
Talleyrand at Versailles at that time. He would have
us believe that he did not know the bishop, but was
struck by this “angel’s face through which broke the
spirit of a devil.” He would have thought it the face
of a fast-living officer, but for the cassock and pectoral
cross. The portrait given in the <i>Galerie des États-Généraux</i>,
of Choderlos de Laclos, is of greater value,
because it was drawn at the time. It gives the estimate
in which he was held by his shrewder contemporaries.
Intelligence, it is said, is his distinctive gift. Moderation,
tact, and restraint are well cultivated. He is mild to a
possible fault. He “yields to circumstances, to reason,
and thinks he can make concessions for the sake of
peace, without deserting the principles which he has
made the ground of his morality and conduct.” His
future depends on himself. If he is influenced by <i>esprit
de corps</i> he will do nothing; if he acts independently
he may do anything. We are justified in thinking that
Talleyrand had made up his mind to act independently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
though he had no dream of leading. He was for a limited
monarchy and a second chamber representing culture
and wealth.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> Beyond this he was for Talleyrand, for
France, and for humanity.</p>

<p>On the very eve of the opening of the States-General
he received another proof of the foolishness of
the order to which he now belonged. A few days before
the 4th the leaders of the clergy met at the Cardinal
de la Rochefoucauld’s house at Versailles to discuss the
situation. All were agreed, to Talleyrand’s disgust, that
this was a favourable opportunity for asking the nation
to extinguish their debt. One of their number was
deputed to introduce the proposal, and for a long time
they clung to it. Clearly, one must not sacrifice much
for clerical <i>esprit-de-corps</i>.</p>

<p>Then the 4th of May arrives. Chaos settles into
order at Versailles. Talleyrand notes the petty devices
by which royalism mitigates its concession of popular
representation. On the previous day the King had
received the deputies: first the Clergy and Nobles, then,
with less ceremony, the Commons. He notes, too, how
the leaders of the Commons are beginning to emphasize
the distinction. “Three orders? No: three nations,”
says Sieyès, constitution-maker for the next ten years.
Now they march to the <i>Salle des menus</i>, all Paris lining
the route or hanging out of the windows. Talleyrand
sees the 550 popular deputies greeted with a roar of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>applause; mostly lawyers, with set faces under their
“slouch-hats.” He sees the plumed and embroidered
nobles, “the illustrious obscure,” tread daintily between
silent hedges of soldiers and people. He marks the
same silence as he and his forty colleagues in violet
cassock and lace surplice step out, followed, with a
convenient band between, by 260 curés. He hears the
shouts of <i>Vive le Roi</i> in the rear: the Queen is ignored.
Even in the intoxication of the spectacle and its
symbolism the people discriminate conspicuously. The
next day he is interested to hear the King express
his pleasure that the privileged “are going to renounce
their privileges” and Necker rub in the lesson. And
he notices that first innovation in the history of France,
when commoners put their hats on before the King
has got out of the room. It is the first shot. On the
third day the Third Estate finds itself alone in the great
hall. The clergy and the nobility are meeting separately,
as of old, to verify their papers. The commoners see
that this means separate votes and impotence, and the
historic battle begins.</p>

<p>History has described the fortunes of the Commons.
I must follow Talleyrand into the obscurer meeting-place
of the First Estate. The Nobles, pampered and
encouraged by the unfortunate Queen, were violently
opposed to union with the Commons. The Clergy
knew they were fatally divided, being themselves
composed of two orders, and their leaders were for a
policy of drifting or compromise. Cardinal de la<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
Rochefoucauld was president, and he contrived to
bring the Clergy together for three hours a day for six
weeks without doing anything. Some of the curés
spoke at once in favour of joining the Commons, but
they were silenced by an agreement to verify their papers
“provisionally” where they were: the delegates from
Paris, and several others, had not yet arrived. The
Commons break in on their provisional action the next
day by inviting them to come into the large hall&mdash;into
which their own hall opens&mdash;and the struggle begins.
The prelates name commissioners to discuss the matter
with their colleagues of the other orders. The Commons,
after a grumble, assent: the Nobles assent, but
practically say their decision is taken. The cardinal
suspends sittings, but there is mutiny amongst the curés,
who are going to appoint a new president, and he hastily
retracts. A week is taken up in “provisional” verification,
voting commissioners, being polite to each other
(except when a deputation comes from Dauphiné to disown
the Archbishop of Vienne as improperly elected),
and hair-splitting. On the 13th they send deputies
to inform the Commons they have appointed commissioners:
the deputies announce on their return that
they were “not so well received as they had expected.”
Fourteen days more are spent in discussing their <i>cahiers</i>
(instructions), disputes about titles and costumes,
abandonment of privileges (which is carried in general
form, but disputed in detail), homage to the King, and
indignation that pamphlets are in circulation accusing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
them of slowness. On the 27th they are “examining
their <i>cahiers</i>” when “a numerous deputation” of grim,
business-like lawyers from the Third break in, and
implore them “in the name of the God of Peace and the
interest of the nation” to stop quibbling and join the
Commons. The deputies are bowed out, and a discussion
follows, which is interrupted by M. Target and
his companions once more with the same message.
They are assured that the Clergy are going to “occupy
themselves seriously” with the matter.</p>

<p>Talleyrand knew (as all his colleagues did) that
these men of business had been sitting in the next room
day after day in the most painful idleness. They would
not open a letter or do a single act that could be construed
as an admission that they were a separate body.
They were “a meeting of citizens,” waiting to be joined
by other citizens to do the business of the State. It
was now clear that their resolution was unshakeable, and
Talleyrand and the moderates cursed Necker very freely.
The situation was becoming serious. Citizens from
Paris (who had now sent their deputies) keep running
down to see how business is proceeding. The curés
are getting restless. One of them is interrupted by a
Vicar-General, and he says: “Hold your tongue,
monsieur.” Prelates leap to their feet in horror. Then
some of the curés induce a secretary to begin at the
bottom of his list when he is calling the names. One of
the bishops rushes at him and snatches the list from his
hand. That night (the 27th) 60 or 70 curés meet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
decide to press matters. The next day there is a warm
debate, when the cardinal produces a letter from the
King, who is painfully surprised to hear there is some
hitch or other; the commissioners will meet to-morrow
in presence of his keeper of the seals. Another
fortnight goes in meetings of commissioners, &amp;c. The
Nobles have sent to say they are determined to remain a
separate order, and the shifty cardinal has betrayed
himself: “Your fathers built and defended our churches:
you will be to-day the saviours of your country.” They
have tried, too, to tempt the Commons into action by
inviting them to discuss the pitiful condition of the
country; just what we are waiting for you to come and
discuss, reply the Commons. Now (the 10th) Sieyès,
the cool, hard-headed ex-theologian, is urging the
Commons to “cut the cable.” On the 12th a deputation
of ten offers a dignified but unmistakeable invitation to
the clergy; they get a promise of “serious consideration.”
The next morning it appears that three curés have
joined the Third; three more go during the discussion:
five the next day. On the 17th they hear that the
Commons have constituted themselves the National
Assembly. On the 19th they put the question of union
to a formal vote. The cardinal says that separation is
maintained by 135 votes against 127. The archbishops
of Vienne and Bordeaux, the leaders of the unionists,
cry that the list has been manipulated, and keep their
party in the hall; they turn out to number 149 (against
115). Talleyrand marches out with the separatists, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
are hooted by the great crowd at the door; the Archbishop
of Vienne and his colleagues are carried in
triumph. Cardinal de la Rochefoucauld and the Archbishop
of Paris fly to the King.</p>

<p>The rest of this story of the disruption of the
First Order and the consequent recognition of the
National Assembly (the Revolution) is well known.
Talleyrand was opposed to union. He looked with
anxiety to the formation, in a totally uneducated country
with a wide franchise, of a single elective chamber.
We know now how just his concern was. He and
the moderate reformers pressed the King (through
M. d’Artois) to dissolve the States-General at whatever
cost, and make a fresh appeal on a stricter franchise.
He was told that it was too late (and in this the King
was probably right), and had then to witness the
miserable devices by which the royal party insinuated
a power they dare not assert. The halls were closed to
prepare for a royal sitting, and the famous oath in the
tennis-court was the result. That night (June 20-21st)
or the following Talleyrand probably made his last
effort to stem the tide of the Revolution. He has told
us in the memoirs how he and one or two other
Liberal nobles went to Marly by night to see and advise
the King.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> The King would not see them, and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>brother told them that their proposals&mdash;namely, that
the King should disperse the present Assembly and
proclaim a fresh election&mdash;could not be considered.
Talleyrand then said that the Prince could not hold
them responsible if in the course of events they felt
compelled to throw in their lot with the popular party,
and M. d’Artois replied that he could not blame them.
Talleyrand thereupon returned to Versailles with a deep
resentment of the folly of the King’s advisers and a
feeling of independence. “Under pain of folly,” he
writes, “it was time to think of oneself.” He, of
course, held to his ideal of a limited monarchy,
but it was clear that this might have to be attained in
spite of the Court party. He proposed to watch the
development closely and act as circumstances would direct.</p>

<p>On the Monday the tennis-court was closed&mdash;reserved
for the Princes to play&mdash;and the deputies,
after wandering about Versailles in sight of an angry
crowd, met in the church of St. Louis. There 151
clerical deputies, with two archbishops at their head,
join them amidst the wildest excitement. The royal
sitting takes place on the Tuesday. The King promises
considerable reforms and then affects authority, and
orders them to separate into their respective rooms.
Talleyrand saw, on the one hand, the delighted nobles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>crowding about the Queen, in the belief that all danger
was over; and, on the other, the sullen Commons send
Brézé to tell the King they will only yield to bayonets,
and King Louis abdicate, as he says, “Let them stay”;
and 6,000 people invade the chateau with cries for
Necker. The Archbishop of Paris has to fly for his
life. Soldiers refuse to fire on the crowd. On the next
day (24th) the clergy find the door walled up that
leads to the Assembly, and the minority continues its
separate sitting, but its members melt away. On the
26th Talleyrand and the Bishop of Orange quietly take
seats in the National Assembly; they are presently
followed by the Archbishop of Paris. On the 27th the
King enjoins the rest of the Clergy and the Nobles to
unite with the National Assembly. Talleyrand sees the
crowds frantically cheer the King and Queen, but he
knows it is the royal submission, not the royal authority,
they are greeting.</p>

<p>It is from this date, and during the next three
years, that Talleyrand is especially found enigmatic, and
I must trace his course with care, avoiding the temptation
to linger over the stirring scenes of the time.
Talleyrand’s opposition to the union of the three orders
is clear enough; he wanted a second chamber as a check
on undisciplined passion. When it became imperative
he went into the Assembly to do what good he should
find possible. He was becoming seriously concerned for
the nation. He knew well the leaders of the democratic
party. Desmoulins was living with his friend Mirabeau
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>at Versailles, and Sieyès was often there. Sieyès ridiculed
the English model. Desmoulins was a Republican.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus_097.jpg" width="400" height="522" alt="" />
<p class="caption">CAMILLE DESMOULINS.</p></div>



<p>On July 7th Talleyrand spoke for the first time
in the Assembly, and made a great impression. The
question had been raised whether the deputies should
still consider themselves bound by the instructions given
them by the electors. Talleyrand, Sieyès and Mirabeau
urged the abandonment of these <i>cahiers</i>, and carried it
by a huge majority. Lytton defends Talleyrand’s action,
and it is intelligible enough. The chief point of his
subtle and rather formal speech is that the new
Assembly is deliberative, and that therefore “imperative”
instructions would only hamper its usefulness. Meantime
the situation outside grows serious. Necker is
dismissed, Paris is breaking prisons, troops are gathering
thick round the capital and Versailles. Talleyrand marks
the ascendancy of the violent Mirabeau. On the 13th
the Assembly, receiving an unsatisfactory reply from the
King, formally demands the withdrawal of the troops,
censures the King’s advisers, decrees the consolidation
of the national debt, and declares its sitting permanent.
After a short adjournment during the night they meet
with grave looks at five on the Tuesday morning, and
settle down to the work of forming a committee to
prepare the constitution.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> Deputies and spectators run
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>in and out all the morning&mdash;the Queen and nobles are
mixing with the soldiers in the orangery, the Parisians
are arming, the air is thick with plots and rebellion. The
Prince de Lambesc gallops past for Paris. Deputies
fancy they hear the sound of cannon. At last the heroic
nerve of the Assembly fails, and Mirabeau proposes that
they send a deputation to the King. Then the Vicomte
de Noailles and others from Paris are announced, and
walk up the great hall amidst a strained silence. The
streets of Paris are red with blood; the people are
storming the Bastille, the symbol of the old order.
About midnight they hear that the Bastille has fallen.
They separate about two, but reassemble early in the
morning, and send deputation after deputation to the
distracted monarch, who has been awakened from his
sleep to be told there is “a revolution.” As the fifth
delegation is going, with a ferocious message from
Mirabeau, King Louis is announced, and is received
with chilling silence. But he makes a fine speech, and
promises everything&mdash;to disband the troops, recall
Necker, and so on.</p>

<p>A feeling akin to that of intoxication is growing
epidemic, but Talleyrand coolly watches the strange
scenes with the keen, blue-grey eyes under the bushy
eye-brows. He sees these prim lawyers crowding like
schoolboys about the King as he returns to the chateau,
covered with sweat and dust, and the royal family again
on the balcony and the great crowds wild with rejoicing.
Then he returns to the hall, and is deputed to set out at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
once with ninety-nine other members to inform Paris
and allay its panic. Through long lines of drawn and
excited faces&mdash;Paris has not been to bed for three days
and nights&mdash;they drive up the Rue Saint Honoré to the
sound of trumpets. At the Hotel de Ville they tell
their news, and heaven and earth seem to melt in
confusion. Lally-Tollendal is crowned with a wreath,
but he passes it on to the archbishop, and the sedate
prelate is dragged to the window where thousands of
Bastille stormers cheer him. Then they march to Notre
Dame to sing a Te Deum. Talleyrand sees the archbishop
arm-in-arm with the black, ragged Abbé Lefèvre,
who has been chief powder-distributor; and the placid,
learned Bailly arm-in-arm with Hullin, the chief Bastille
stormer, with four fusiliers as guard of honour. On
they go through lanes of patriots&mdash;many of them monks
and priests&mdash;with bloody pikes and axes and scythes,
and faces unwashed for a week, and scraps of valuable
old armour from the museums over tattered costumes.
What a Paris compared with that he had left only three
months before.</p>

<p>The following morning the deputies gave an
account to the Assembly, and crowned the confusion by
proposing to erect a statue of the King on the site of the
Bastille. That night M. d’Artois and the Court nobles
fled from France. It is probable enough that Talleyrand
saw him, though the account in the memoirs is very
inaccurate; he states explicitly that he was invited to fly
with the Prince, but refused. In the morning the King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
went to Paris&mdash;driving between 200,000 silent men
with pikes, sabres, scythes, axes, and lances&mdash;and
renewed his promises. But as the news of the fall of
the Bastille spread through the provinces it lit up the
same conflagration over the country. About sixty
monasteries and nunneries were burned in Talleyrand’s
diocese. His uncle’s chateau was burned down during
the night of July 29th. The Assembly appointed a
committee to enquire into the disorders whilst it
discussed the advisability of prefixing a declaration of the
Rights of Man to the new Constitution. Fifty deputies
demanded speech on the subject, and the flow of oratory
began on August 1st. Meantime addresses and deputations
poured in on the Assembly from all parts:
thirty-one on July 24th, thirty-eight on the 28th, and
so on.</p>

<p>By August 4th the deputies seem to have been
wrought to a curious pitch of nervousness by the oratory
and the addresses. In the morning a letter from the
King is read, from which they learn that their Archbishop
of Bordeaux has been made Keeper of the Seals,
and the Archbishop of Vienne has been given the
<i>feuille des bénéfices</i>. There is great rejoicing and acclamation
of the King. In the afternoon the Vicomte de
Noailles mounts the tribune and proposes that, in “this
age of light, when sound philosophy has regained its
sway,” the nobles shall lay at the feet of the nation
every one of their privileges. The Duc d’Aiguillon
supports the proposal. A marquis, another viscount,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
and a bishop (a colleague quarrelling for priority) follow
with the same story. Michelet is unfair when he says
the Clergy were the last and the least willing to join.
Soon the steps of the tribune are crowded with men
eager to renounce age-old privileges, and a scene unique
in the history of the world is witnessed. Nobles
abdicate their feudal rights, bishops abandon their
benefices, the Clergy rise in a body to renounce tithe,
starving curés forswear their miserable incomes (without
a smile), barons part with their baronies, towns and
provinces give up their proudest privileges. Time
after time business&mdash;if this ought to be called business&mdash;is
suspended till emotions can subside a little. At
two in the morning they conclude with the ordering
of a special medal and a <i>Te Deum</i>.</p>

<p>We do not distinguish Talleyrand in the crowd
of enthusiasts, but he soon appears when it comes to the
sober and detailed execution of the promise. On the
6th he proposed to distinguish between feudal rights
that could be forthwith extinguished and rights that
should be compensated. On the 11th he becomes more
prominent. It was understood on the 4th that tithe
would be redeemed, but, some of the Clergy haggling a
little, the philosophic Marquis Lacoste proposed on the
10th that they abolish it outright, and Chasset made a
formal motion to that effect. The Clergy resisted
at first, and Sieyès supported them; but on the 11th the
Archbishop of Paris declared with great solemnity that
the Clergy surrendered its tithe to the nation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
trusted to its honour for a proper provision for worship
and religion. There was a loud outburst of applause,
and the Cardinal de la Rochefoucauld and several
bishops rose to support their leader. Then the deep,
slow, suave voice of Talleyrand broke through the
uproar, and, to the astonishment of all, he drily
demanded that it be entered in the minutes that
Chasset’s motion of the previous day had been passed
unanimously. This meant nearly all the difference
between an enforced and a voluntary surrender. It was
the beginning of Talleyrand’s secession from the clerical
body. It is usually thought that he wanted to conciliate
the Radicals by having the result cast in the form of a
victory for them. It is probable enough that this was in
his mind, but it is probable too that he distrusted
sentimental promises and thought it advisable to have a
formal motion passed.</p>

<p>The remainder of August was taken up with the
discussion of the form in which the Rights of Man
should be declared. Talleyrand intervened once or
twice with effect. It was he, supported by Mirabeau,
who induced the Assembly to cut out the two Articles
relating to religion and morals. He has been censured
for this, but his speech is a quite honest plea for a
purely secular and political declaration, without any
antagonism to religion. Long afterwards we shall find
him pleading eloquently for moral instruction and for
lessons in religion in the schools. On the 18th he was
appointed Secretary, and on the 27th spoke with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
effect in support of a proposed loan. In the long and
stormy debates of September on the subject of the royal
Veto, in the course of which the distinction of Right
and Left became fully pronounced, Talleyrand took no
part. The life of the people’s Assembly must have
jarred on his taste. A hundred deputies at once would
spring to their feet and out-bawl each other, only the
roar of a Mirabeau or a Maury being heard through
the din. Gallery also joined in&mdash;encouraging, threatening,
whistling and singing. How Talleyrand must have
longed for his Upper House&mdash;and a seat in it!
Through this chaotic period it was almost useless to
have a constructive policy. His one preoccupation
was, as Aimée de Coigny afterwards said, to assist in
allaying violence and to see that as little blood as
possible be shed. His moderate colleagues on the
Constitution-Committee resigned, but he and Sieyès
were appointed on the new committee, and he continued
his effort to frame a constitutional check for the daily
increasing violence.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">THE BREACH WITH THE CHURCH</span></p>


<p>When, in later years, Talleyrand looked back on the
many oaths of allegiance he had successively sworn, he
affirmed that he had never deserted any cause until it
had abandoned itself. This is most certainly true of his
desertion of the Royalist cause. His political ideal
essentially and to the end included the element of
limited monarchy; and his whole temper and taste
would make him reluctant to turn from Versailles to the
Paris of the end of 1789. A chaos, of which the issue
was quite inconceivable, had succeeded to the older
order. But the King and Queen had surrounded
themselves with evil councillors from the first, and the
throne was tottering. Talleyrand took no part in the
long debates on the King’s Veto. The fact that the
Assembly was discussing it at all meant, as he must have
seen clearly, that a greater power than the King now
ruled in France. He only can give or withhold an
authority who possesses it.</p>

<p>Moreover, the royal party seemed to learn nothing
from experience to the end. The King, indeed, was
recognizing the permanence of the Revolution to some
extent; nor was he without humane consciousness that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
it had been merited. With a wistful glance back at the
golden days that were gone, he was clumsily learning
his part as “Restorer of French Liberty” and loser of
French autocracy. But “the Austrian” was far from
reconciled, and what was left of the light-headed Court
was frenzied with mortification. The debates on the
Veto were answered by the military banquet in the
Chateau on October 1st, by the huge white cockades at
Versailles and black cockades at Paris. In the afternoon
of the 5th the sitting of the Assembly is disturbed
by whispers of Paris marching on Versailles. Presently
the trickling stream of oratory is stopped by the sound
of an approaching army, irregular and noisy. A
deputation from Paris is announced, and fifteen indescribable
females enter. With an implied disdain of
constitution-making, they have come for mere vulgar
bread. Talleyrand and his colleagues pour out and
gaze with bewilderment on one more unique scene in
the human drama&mdash;five thousand muddy, draggled,
hungry, dangerous women of every type and complexion.
The rest is familiar. Talleyrand saw the
strange army surge and beat and roar about the gates of
the Chateau, until the inevitable shot was fired, and
the tide poured in and for a moment seemed likely
to settle a good deal of the Constitution. Then it
was rolled back upon Paris&mdash;but taking the King,
now sunk to office of “chief baker” with it.
Monarchy was over in France. There was no question
of deserting it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<p>But what shall we say of his desertion of the
Church, whose rights, privileges and properties he had
sworn to defend on that gala-day at Autun seven months
ago? When we go back to his election address,
endorsed by the electors as their <i>cahier</i> of instructions,
we are reminded that Talleyrand hinted long ago that
titles to property must be scrutinised. It is almost
certain that he was thinking of Church property. However
that may be, the country had in October to face an
appalling scarcity of bread and money. The loans could
not be raised: the silver of the churches had been melted
down: patriotic gifts had poured fruitlessly into the
insatiable caisse: respectable ladies had sent their
jewellery and other ladies had offered their earnings:
monks had tendered their monasteries. The whole
nation had caught the fever of August 4th. But the
deficit remained, and very many eyes were turned
towards the property of the Church, estimated to be
worth 2,100,000,000 livres. The idea of appropriating
this to national purposes had been broached in the
Assembly early in August, and had been supported by
several speakers. In the national emergency the proposal
was certain to be voted sooner or later&mdash;probably sooner.
Talleyrand put his name down for a speech on the
subject, and it was delivered on October 10th. In it he
urged the nation to assume the ownership of all the
Church property in France.</p>

<p>It is impossible to read his speech without feeling
that a sincere national interest inspires it. He points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
out that, in its distress, the nation has hitherto left one
class of property untouched, and that, nevertheless, the
clergy are probably expecting some change in their
position, now that tithe has been suppressed. The
clergy are not proprietors in the ordinary sense of the
word. Estates are not so much left <i>to them</i>, as left for
the performance of certain functions. A nation which
has felt justified in dealing with tithe may go on to
appropriate estates. In this a great saving can be made
without injustice. The actual revenue of the Church is
(to strike the average of estimates) 150,000,000. But
religion can be fully provided for by the State out of a
revenue of 100,000,000, and this may be gradually
reduced to 80 or 85 millions. Sinecures will be
abolished. Useless religious communities will be dispersed
and compensated. At the same time the income
of the curé will be raised to 1,200 livres a year and a
house; and the clergy must have the first claim on the
national revenue, and be paid in advance. He then
shows how the sale of Church property may be made to
yield 2,100,000,000 livres, and concludes with an
attractive sketch of the expenditure of the profit.</p>

<p>The style of the speech is plain, except in the peroration,
but it is solid and convincing. We can well believe
that the speaker was interrupted over and over again
with loud applause. Here was a financial expert, and a
bishop, putting in impressive form the vague dream of
so many of them. From the Right, naturally, came a
flood of rhetoric. The Abbé Maury bitterly assailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
Talleyrand, while Mirabeau vigorously defended the
proposal.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> But Talleyrand took no further share in the
debate. He wished to speak again on November 2nd,
the day the law was passed, but the closure had to be
voted, and he was content to publish his speech (which
was written, as was customary in the Assembly). The
second speech adds little to the first, which had now, by
order of the Assembly, been printed and distributed
throughout the country. That he strengthened his
position with the Radicals need not be stated. The
<i>Moniteur</i> spoke of him as “the youngest, most intrepid,
and most enlightened prelate in the ecclesiastical college.”
The pamphleteers of the Right denounced him as “the
limping devil,” “Judas,” “the disgrace and scandal of
the Clergy, the shame of the nobility, the basest and
vilest of gamblers.” The last phrase was suggested by
the Abbé Maury’s declaration that Talleyrand was acting
in concert with Jewish speculators. We may remember
that, as Castellane points out, Talleyrand’s proposal
would have the effect of reducing his own income to the
most slender proportions. We must admit, too, that
the appropriation of Church property was only a matter
of time; and we must allow the probability of M. de
Lacombe’s suggestion that Talleyrand feared the confiscation
would be carried with the rough injustice and
ignorance now so often exhibited in the Assembly, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>he resolved to secure a just and rational settlement by
his action. When we have admitted all this, there is
little reason for us to seek further and dishonourable
motives. We shall find him later boldly reminding the
Assembly of their engagement to stoop to no injustice
in the matter.</p>

<p>Not so leniently can we pass over a letter to his
diocese, bearing the date of October 12th, which must
have been written while he was preparing his speech.
It enjoins the prayers of the Quarant Ore in accordance
with the King’s instructions, but it is painfully religious.
“The religion of Our Lord,” it begins, “is the firmest
support of thrones, the most solid ground for the
prosperity of States. In vain does the pride of man
spend itself in brilliant speculations on the alleged force
of reason and nature in systems of government that are
independent of religion.” The work was most probably
entrusted to Des Renaudes. Talleyrand’s clergy had
been somewhat shaken when they heard of his voting
for the abolition of tithe. After his speech of
October 10th they wrote a strong letter of protest.
Talleyrand replied with vague and mild excuses, and
they retorted with some warmth; but he took no
further notice, and the quarrel was suspended.</p>

<p>Meantime the Assembly had followed the King to
Paris, and was meeting temporarily at the Archbishop’s
palace, now deserted by the emigrant prelate. It would
be difficult to imagine the feelings of even the staid
Talleyrand after this transfer into the very crater of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
national volcano. A glance at the Minutes of the
Assembly shows a kind of panic amongst the Deputies.
On October 9th the President was asked to grant 200
passports to members of the Assembly. Disease spread
amongst them with appalling effect as the date
approached for going to Paris. Even presidents complained
of “extinction of the voice” when awkward
debates came on; and one needed some voice in an
Assembly where three orators would occupy the tribune
at once, to the accompaniment of a hundred others and
several hundred spectators. It must have been hopelessly
bewildering to moderate politicians and refined
people like Talleyrand. Moreover, one beacon that
had more or less guided him so far was extinguished.
He had looked forward to a place in the Ministry.
Mirabeau had included him in his scheme of a Ministry,
when the patriots got wind of it, and, at the beginning
of November, passed a law that no member of the
Assembly should accept any office or commission for
two years after leaving it. The pay of an ordinary
Deputy was 18 francs a day. Calculation was now of
little use. Talleyrand must either emigrate, and leave
France to the violent and ignorant, or remain an
observant member of the Assembly, and cultivate faith
and hope.</p>

<p>One better feature of the time was that the
powerful Mirabeau was becoming alarmed. When he
had whispered to the President of the Assembly on
October 5th that “Paris is marching on us,” he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
been told that it was “so much the better; we shall get
a Republic all the sooner.” Talleyrand and he and other
constitutionalists met at the “Society of Friends of the
Constitution,” the successor of the Breton Club, meeting
now in the library of the Jacobin convent in the Rue
Saint-Honoré. Its debates were then quiet and orderly,
the general public not being admitted. Most of the
abler moderates met there&mdash;Duport, Barnave, Lameth
(the well-known triumvirate&mdash;“triumscroundrelate,”
Mirabeau said later), Sieyès, Chapelier, the Duc
d’Aiguillon, &amp;c. Many non-deputies, especially writers,
were admitted after the transfer to Paris, and the club
became a lively centre of journalism and pamphleteering.
Gradually it became infected with the general violence
of the time, and Talleyrand and the moderates left it in
May to found the more respectable club of the Feuillants,
with La Fayette, Bailly, Sieyès, Chamfort, and Marmontel.
But Paris was being rapidly denuded of all that appealed
to Talleyrand. By the middle of October there were
60,000 émigrés in Switzerland alone. The society that
replaced them must have tried Talleyrand’s infinite
restraint. One of Napoleon’s rough marshals said of
him that “you could attack him thirty times in the
rear (<i>coups de derrière</i>) before any indication appeared on
his face.” He needed that quality most of all in the
days of the Revolution.</p>

<p>During the remainder of 1789 he confined himself
to practical work and moderation. On November 7th
he appeared in the tribune to appeal for the proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
protection of the confiscated estates. Towards the close
of the month he was appointed on the bank committee,
and he delivered its report on December 4th&mdash;a very
able, technical discourse on the bank question, directed
to be published by the Assembly. In December he
helped to carry the abolition of the royal lottery, and in
January he still further embittered his former friends of
the Right by securing the enfranchisement of the Jews
in the south. We have also speeches of his pleading
for a uniform standard of weights and measures in
the country (of which he afterwards sent a copy to
Sir J. R. Miller, who was urging the cause in England),
and on registration fees and the coinage of small money.</p>

<p>But his most important achievement about this
time was the eloquent defence of the Assembly which he
delivered on February 10th. Carlyle’s disparagement of
that body’s labours is a faithful, if not very judicious,
reproduction of what the crowds and the pamphleteers
were saying. The plague of pamphlets was now at
its height. E. de Goncourt says that 6,000 men were
engaged in distributing them daily. The Cordeliers
district had taken under its august protection any
scribblers in its area, because the liberty of the press
followed from the liberty of man. As a result the
Assembly was constantly attacked, in the “theory-of-irregular-verbs”
spirit. It was still too full of
“aristocrocs” or “aristocranes”: it was a mere talking-shop.
“Dames of the market” had been in it
themselves, and knew. The Assembly directed its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
constitution-committee to inform France what it had
done. The committee entrusted the work to Talleyrand,
and he gave them a pyrotechnic display which
brought on again that “species of intoxication” which
was growing familiar to chroniclers. The <i>Moniteur</i>
reporter (Is there a parallel to this in the history of
reporting?) was too overcome with emotion even to
remember its chief points; but he excuses himself with
the plea that no patriot could have done otherwise. It
evoked, he said, “applause without example.” But
it was read again the next day and published, and then
scattered lovingly over France at the expense of the
Assembly. It is certainly a fine piece of rhetoric, with
some notable phrases. “The King desires to guard his
people from the flatterers he has driven away from
his throne.” “Patience! It is for liberty. You have
given so many centuries to despotism!” Talleyrand won
a great deal of popularity by the speech. Ten days
afterwards he was elected President of the Assembly
(for the customary fortnight), in opposition to Sieyès, by
323 votes to 125. He was often cheered in the
street, and once Mirabeau and he were called to the
window by an admiring crowd during a banquet at
the Palais Royal.</p>

<p>His diocese, as we can imagine, did not regard
this new kind of distinction with satisfaction. At the
beginning of the year he had sent them his greeting, and
they had responded. But during the stormy debates of
February, on the suppression of the monastic orders and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
the civil constitution of the clergy, they looked in vain
for the name of their Bishop. Talleyrand took no part
in the struggle. He saw the suppression of monasteries
decreed on February 13th&mdash;and Capuchin monks rush
to be shaved as soon as the report came, while others
rushed to less respectable establishments without waiting
to cast off their habits. He gave no assistance to the
religious speakers of April 12-13th who tried to induce
the Assembly to make a formal declaration that the
Catholic Church was the Church of the nation, and he
refused to sign their subsequent protest. Then his clergy
reminded him of his office. No doubt, they said, with
some irony, he had only abstained in the idea of making
a more solemn protest at the head of his clergy. They
had signed a protest and forwarded it to him to head
the list of signatures and present to the Assembly. He
sent a conciliatory reply, pointing out that it was unwise
to ask a political body to meddle with religion: the
Catholic faith <i>was</i> the religion of the nation. His people
were divided on the receipt of this letter, but one of his
Vicars-General made a vehement attack on him, and the
local pamphleteers entertained each other for a time.
Talleyrand’s policy was really clear enough. He believed
that religion was wholly necessary for the people, and
had no thought of impairing its action. But he knew
that there were grave abuses to be suppressed, and he
was content to watch, in the interest of the nation and
of justice, while the State took over control of the
Church. Twice he intervened with dignity and courage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
for justice to the clergy; once on June 13th, when he
reminded the Assembly of its promise to treat the
despoiled clergy as the first creditors of the State, and
again on September 24th. Dillon afterwards claimed
that he and the majority of his colleagues acted “as true
gentlemen,” but would hardly claim religious motives.
Talleyrand could say as much.</p>

<p>His popularity with the Left and the bitterness of
the Right were doubled when he said Mass for the last
time on July 14th&mdash;the famous Mass of the Champ de
Mars. Much has been written, in the way of sneers,
on that famous ceremony, and Talleyrand’s share in it;
much of it is clearly unjust. It must be remembered
that the demonstration in the Champ de Mars was not a
piece of ritual arbitrarily devised to satisfy the sooty
citizens who had taken the Bastille. Before the end of
the preceding year this collective demonstration and
oath-taking had started in provincial towns. As the
months of 1790 advanced Paris was piqued to hear that
town after town was solemnly swearing loyalty to King
and constitution&mdash;or constitution and King&mdash;without
any lead from itself. In May Lyons sent word that it
had conducted a most enthusiastic ceremony of the kind.
Paris <i>must</i> conclude and crown the series. The
anniversary of the taking of the Bastille was divinely
appointed for it, and the Champ de Mars provided. The
municipality decreed it, and invited delegations from all
parts of France. Clearly there were great moral
possibilities in such an event. A banner could be raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
there under which all parties could gather, except the
extreme Right; and that banner might be&mdash;with
embroideries and fringes&mdash;the banner of constitutionalism.
As July 14th drew near everything pointed
to the realisation of these hopes. Talleyrand was
nominated by the King to preside episcopally at the
function. He saw the theatre of the demonstration
growing into shape during that marvellous fortnight:
saw boys and girls, and university professors and curés,
and prostitutes and countesses (among them his old
friend, Mme. de Genlis, with a “mahogany barrow,”
and a little model of the Bastille at her neck), and
butchers and brigands and lawyers, decked with
tricolours and cockades, digging and singing and
wheeling barrows. It was a new “species of intoxication,”
but most certainly it might mean a rally to a constitutional
ideal, burned in by a blazing pageantry.</p>

<p>I believe myself it was with these thoughts that
Talleyrand faced his great audience from the high altar
on July 14th. Imagine oneself looking out on that living
amphitheatre of 300,000 incandescent souls, all, or nearly
all, in transfigured earnest, swearing loyalty to King and
law and nation; and think what type of man would be
like to mock at it. Surely not one who felt, if ever he
felt anything, that a serious rally to a national idea was
the pressing need of France. The statement that Talleyrand
whispered mocking words to Lafayette as he
mounted the steps rests on the thinnest of rumours, too
eagerly welcomed by Sainte-Beuve. Lafayette does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
confirm it; he would, in fact, be the last man to whom
Talleyrand would say them, if he had them on his lips,
for <i>he</i> would surely see the symbolic power of the
moment. And the supposed letter to Mme. de Flahaut,
in which Talleyrand is made to sneer at the ceremony, is
not worth considering. For most of Talleyrand’s actions
during these two years we have to construct ourselves
the inner mood. The memoirs are almost silent. In
this case it is difficult to believe that Talleyrand missed
the real potency of the occasion, and we have no evidence
to make us think so. The suspicion arises from a twofold
mistake. It is too readily assumed that Talleyrand
had no serious interests, but was ever in the mood of
Goethe’s Mephistopheles. This is false. His affection
began at home, if you will, but his public and political
action constantly shows that it did not end there. In
the second place, the theological element of the demonstration
is taken too literally and too narrowly. The fact
that Talleyrand and his deacon and sub-deacon (Louis
and des Renaudes) were rationalists is no impediment
whatever to their being thoroughly serious. Like many
priests before and since they took their service
symbolically, and looked to the effect on the audience.
The ceremony was religious on quite other grounds
from those on which the theologian examines it. I
respect his technical objection, but the religion remains.</p>

<p>For my part I cannot conceive a man so sensible
as Talleyrand was of the needs of France, and the
possibilities of such a ceremony, looking with even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
indifference from those altar-steps. Would the fire of
their enthusiasm burn on? Would this idea of allegiance
to law and an orderly constitution work deeper
into them? If so, it were well for France; but even if
not, it was worth attempting. It was a great political
experiment.</p>

<p>Talleyrand’s diocesans would be represented on
the benches of provincial delegates, but we do not find
them quarrelling with him again until he accepts the
civil constitution of the clergy. In the discussions of
religious and ecclesiastical affairs that continued through
the whole year he took no part, except, as I said, to
intervene twice when there seemed danger of injustice
to the clergy. On the financial side of the proceedings
he spoke several times. In their ignorance of the
elements of political economy, the majority wished to
treat the confiscated estates as so much wealth actually
added to the country’s resources, or to dispose of them
at a ruinous loss. Talleyrand firmly pointed out the
fallacies of their view, and pleaded for a wise and
business-like procedure in turning the estates into
available money. The flooding of the country with
paper-money&mdash;“robbery by violence” Mirabeau called
it&mdash;was a serious addition to the financial confusion of
the times. But in spite of Talleyrand’s clear and
earnest warning, supported by all the financiers, the
temptation to issue the paper-currency on the strength
of the new estates was too great, and Talleyrand had
again to bemoan in private the immature democracy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
that had assumed power. He retained his popularity,
however, and was mentioned for the Archbishopric of
Paris in September. He wrote a curious letter to the
<i>Moniteur</i> on the 8th of September, disclaiming any
ambition for the post, but at the same time replying
to the personal charges which the rumour had caused the
Right to circulate. He denied that he was addicted to
<i>heavy</i> gambling, but admitted that he had won 30,000
francs at the Chess Club. With a rather hollow show
of penitence, he allowed that he had no excuse to make
for his gaming, and said that the State ought to interfere
and protect citizens from themselves in the matter.</p>

<p>But the determination of the Constituent Assembly
to control the Church and force it into the political
unity of the State was gradually nearing its climax,
and was to close Talleyrand’s clerical career. It is
hardly surprising that he did not take part in the
debates. The issue was never really doubtful, and on the
whole would not displease Talleyrand. His abstinence
should be construed in his favour; no one could
seriously expect him to stand for the autonomy of the
Church. The priest was, in his opinion, a moral
functionary (for the masses) or nothing, and his work
was part of the nation’s life. His experience and his
knowledge of history would tell him the danger of
leaving the clergy “a State within a State.” He would
regard with satisfaction the suppression (on the just
conditions he had himself laid down) of the monastic
orders and the redistribution of income. He would hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
resent the rearrangement of ecclesiastical divisions, the
exclusion of the Pope, and the elective character of the
new hierarchy. Certainly he must have foreseen the
disturbances that interference in these matters would
cause, but that was a concern of the executive. With
the Archbishop of Sens (de Brienne), the Bishop of
Orleans, the Bishop of Vivières, three bishops <i>in
partibus</i>, and 66 curés, he took the oath and accepted
the civil constitution of the clergy. Archbishop Dillon
and 130 prelates refused to submit&mdash;the majority of
them doing so, Dillon said, as gentlemen, not as
theologians. The distinction is unfortunate, though
necessary. They had plunged the country in a civil
war which only a strict regard for their theology could
have justified.</p>

<p>Talleyrand had no more respect for theology
than Dillon (and “most of his colleagues,” to use
Dillon’s words), but he professed to regard the new
State control as purely disciplinary, and wrote to invite
his clergy to follow his example. They sent him a fiery
reply, promising him “infamy in this world and eternal
reprobation in the next,” and declining to “follow
him into the abyss.” After the passing of the civil
constitution the municipal authorities of Autun had
notified Talleyrand’s chapter of the cessation of their
functions, and sealed the door of the chapter-house.
They continued to meet, however, in private and discuss
the morals of their bishop. In the rearrangement of
ecclesiastical areas the authorities had contrived to leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
Autun an episcopal centre, but on January 21st
Talleyrand resigned his See. He had, he politely
explained, been elected a member of the Department
of Paris, and must in future reside constantly in the
capital! Lytton’s statement that Talleyrand remained
throughout life very sensitive to any reference to his
bishopric, and that a lady once greatly disturbed him by
dropping the word “lawn,” is not to be taken seriously.
His friends continued to call him “the bishop” for
years after (witness the correspondence in 1792 of
Narbonne and Lauzun). There is as little plausibility in
the story of the Prince of Condé once asking him “what
had become of some precious relative of his who used
to be Bishop of Autun.” No one not gifted with the
skin of an elephant would venture to say such things
to Talleyrand. I may add that Talleyrand, under the
Directorate, more than once sent help to emigrant
members of his old clergy who had censured him.</p>

<p>One more episcopal act must be mentioned before
Monseigneur becomes plain Citizen Talleyrand. The
administration appointed two new bishops, but had
retained sufficient respect for the apostolic succession
to require their proper consecration. Several of the
rallied prelates refused, and Talleyrand promised to
officiate, with the assistance of two of the bishops <i>in
partibus</i>, Gobel and Mirondot. The latter withdrew at
the last moment. Talleyrand saw him, and is said to
have worked on his feelings by toying with the handle
of a pistol and talking of suicide. The three bishops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
and the candidates conducted this ceremony on the
following day in a curious environment. The chapel
was strongly guarded by soldiers, and a military band
supplied the music. Saint-Sulpice sent its master of
ceremonies to keep the eye of a ritualist expert on
Talleyrand, but was disappointed in its search for an
essential flaw. The American envoy, Morris, tells that
Talleyrand’s dread of violence from the orthodox
occasioned a good deal of grief to his friend, Mme.
de Flahaut. The night before the ceremony she
received an envelope containing his will, and sent in
search of him. He did not return to his house that
night, and she feared a catastrophe. The truth was
that, conceiving an attack to be possible, he had slept
away from home, and had directed his will to be sent to
her only in case of anything happening.</p>

<p>Lytton, a very careful if not generous judge of
Talleyrand’s career, looks upon this ordination as one
of his “unpardonable” acts. It is one of those acts as
to which one’s judgment is almost inevitably swayed
by one’s religious views. Talleyrand explains in his
memoirs that he did it to save the Gallican Church
from falling into Presbyterianism from sheer lack of
bishops. The paragraph is ingenious, but not very
convincing. Nearer to the point seems to be an answer
he gave in later years, according to a letter of the
Duchess de Dino to Dupanloup. When asked to
explain some action or other, he answered that it was
impossible to explain many things done at the time of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
the Revolution; the disorder was so great that people
hardly knew what they were doing. If we could
succeed in putting ourselves in the frame of mind of
a man who had lived through the bewilderingly rapid
changes of 1789 and 1790, we should be in a position to
pass moral judgment on him. To do it in the light of
our calm standards, in our placid days, is absurd.
However, my purpose is only to have Talleyrand
understood, and there is in this ordination nothing
inconsistent with the ideas and policy he has hitherto
followed.</p>

<p>But Rome now found itself obliged to interfere and
clip the wings of this dangerous bishop at large. On
May 1st the <i>Moniteur</i> published the announcement from
the Vatican that Talleyrand was suspended, and would
incur excommunication if he “did not return to penance
within the space of forty days.” The romantic
biographers say that the only notice Talleyrand took of
it was to invite Lauzun to supper to console him, adding
that “as he was now denied fire and water they would
have to be content with wine and iced foods.” Unfortunately,
the story had been told before, and Talleyrand
did not plagiarise. The censure would not distress him.
We can, in fact, imagine that he would close his clerical
career with some relief. It had imposed not a little
duplicity on him. In justice to him we must remember
that he had been forced into the clerical estate, had been
unchecked in his irregular ideas and habits, had been
promoted from order to order by those who were fully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
acquainted with them, and, in fine, found a position like
his sanctioned by almost his whole social class. Yet this
chapter alone of his career will prevent one from ever
calling him “great,” except in the qualified sense of a
great diplomatist.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">CITIZEN TALLEYRAND</span></p>


<p>Talleyrand explains in the Memoirs that, after
resigning his bishopric, he “put himself at the disposal of
events.” “Provided I remained a Frenchman” he says,
“I was prepared for anything.” The outlook must have
been blank and perplexing. His ecclesiastical income
was entirely stopped, and he was prevented by the vote
of the Assembly from accepting a place in the Ministry,
or any paid office under Government, for two years.
He had, however, been appointed member of the newly-formed
and important Department of Paris on
January 18th. He retained this municipal office for
eighteen months, and there and on the Assembly did
some good work during the course of the year 1791.
Sieyès and Mirabeau were elected with him: Danton
followed on January 31st. Within six months two
events of great importance occurred&mdash;the death of
Mirabeau and the flight of the King. Each event left
the outlook darker for constitutionalists like Talleyrand.</p>

<p>Mirabeau had realised at length that France was
travelling <i>downwards</i>, and had secretly rallied to the
Court. Talleyrand was accused later of having done
the same; but he denied it, and there was no solid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
proof, as we shall see. It is by no means unlikely that
Mirabeau would tell the King of Talleyrand’s disposition
as a monarchist and constitutionalist. On the extreme
left in the Assembly a menacing group was forming, and
was gaining favour in Paris and the provinces. It was
also dominating the club at the Jacobins and extending
its influence over France through the affiliated clubs.
Mirabeau roared down the violent suggestions of these
Marats and Robespierres for a time, but his constitution
was shattered<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> by excess and work. He died on April
2nd, taking with him, he said, “the doom of monarchy.”
Talleyrand was with him for a couple of hours before
he died, and the interview is generally described as the
bequeathing of Mirabeau’s plans to him. Lamartine says
he left Talleyrand “all his grand views in his grand
speech;” another writer says he left him his idea of an
alliance between England and France. Talleyrand read
Mirabeau’s last words at the Assembly. The notion of
a bequeathing and inheriting of views is exaggerated.
Talleyrand had been friendly with Mirabeau in the
intervals of their numerous quarrels, but he was not likely
to be influenced by him&mdash;if by anybody. Mirabeau’s
violence and intemperance imposed restraint on him.
Their views largely coincided, and, just as Talleyrand’s
few and wise proposals in the Assembly had almost
always had Mirabeau’s support, so, now that Mirabeau
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>was gone, Talleyrand seemed to be continuing his views
in the Assembly. The idea of drawing towards England
had been expressed by him twelve months before, in his
letter to Sir J. R. Miller. As Talleyrand was nominated
to the place left vacant by Mirabeau on the diplomatic
committee he would naturally begin to give greater
prominence to this idea.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus_129.jpg" width="400" height="536" alt="" />
<p class="caption">MIRABEAU.</p></div>


<p>A week later Talleyrand gave a proof of the
moderation and splendid balance of his character.
At Paris the priests who would not take the oath
according to the new civil constitution of the clergy were
being roughly handled by the “patriots.” Talleyrand
induced the Department to pass a measure for their
protection. Six weeks earlier his life had been
threatened by these “Nonconformists,” as he called
them. Now he endangered his popularity in securing
for them complete liberty to follow their cult in their
own way, in churches specially assigned to them. It
is not scholarship, but partisanship, to ignore the traits
of character&mdash;the unchanging concern for justice,
humanity and moderation&mdash;which inspire these interventions
on behalf of his bitter enemies, and in
antagonism to the dominant feeling, and then pronounce
Talleyrand a “sphinx.” A little later (May 7th)
he repeated his plea to the Assembly. He had to
report the discussion of the constitution-committee on
a decree of the Department of Paris in reference to
deserted religious edifices. He upheld the right of the
municipality to dispose of these, and went on to plead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
again for liberty for the “Nonconformists.” “Let us
not speak of tolerance,” he finely says; “such a
domineering expression is an insult, and should no
longer be found in the language of a free and
enlightened people.” The king himself, “the first
functionary of the nation,” shall be free “like other
functionaries” to worship as a Nonconformist if he
wishes: only not in his character of State-official. On
the other hand, these Nonconformists must drop their
ridiculous talk of “schism.” A nation cannot be
schismatic until it declares itself in rebellion against
the Church. He politely invites the Pope to mind his
own business. I repeat that there is nothing mysterious
about these actions except to men whose personal
experience disables them from understanding a passionless
moral and intellectual consistency.</p>

<p>The reference to the King reminds us of the other
great event of 1791 that prepared the way for the
Terror. With religious conscientiousness, but political
folly, the King had tried to leave the Tuileries for
the purpose of making his Pâques at Saint-Cloud.
Lafayette was willing; but the Jacobins saw, in long
perspective, a flight over the frontier and an Austrian
invasion. There was another fatal conflict of mob and
authority, and victory for the mob. On the following
day the Department of Paris sent a letter of censure
to the King for his impolitic attempt. M. Belloc says
the letter has been imputed to Danton, but was really
written by Talleyrand. He is quite right, as Talleyrand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
says in his letter to the Convention from London
(December 12th, 1792), that he “redacted this famous
address of the Department,” and, in fact, took it himself
to the King: not impossibly using the opportunity to
gild the pill. But the brain of Louis XVI was not
likely to be the only one to remain unintoxicated in
such times. Indeed, calm political wisdom, looking back
now from placid studies, is at a loss to determine the
move he ought to have taken. A royalist plot, an
unguarded door, and he was off on the night of
June 20th for Metz.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> On the evening of the 26th
Talleyrand saw the sad return again through the lane
of some hundred thousand faces, not now cheering,
not frigidly silent, but surly and menacing. For a time
the increased danger rallied the constitutionalists. They
had left the Jacobin club, and met at the Feuillants, where
all that was left of moderation and constitutionalism
now gathered. But the ancient homes of the Dominicans
(Jacobins) and the Franciscans (Cordeliers) had become
furnaces, heating Paris. The party on the extreme
Left had found a “new fact” to proceed on. Talleyrand’s
speech of May 7th had been loudly applauded and
placarded<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> over Paris and the provinces. Evidently
the situation was then far from hopeless. But this
pardonable madness&mdash;unpardonable only in its stupid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>details and blunders&mdash;of the King had wrought
terrible mischief. Paris rose, and Lafayette crushed
it, and made it a more bitter enemy than ever of
constitutionalism, more accessible to the new Dominicans
and Franciscans&mdash;Danton, Marat, Desmoulins,
Pétion, Robespierre, and the rest.</p>

<p>One other day does Talleyrand fill the Salle de
Manège with ringing applause before the Constituent
Assembly breaks up. We rarely catch sight of him in
these long and angry debates that fill whole sessions,
when the victory is to the strong-lunged. But nearly
on every single occasion when his low-pitched, deliberate
voice is heard, putting judicious views in temperate,
lucid, convincing language, he obtains his point. On
September 10th he has his last declaration to make in
the name of the constitution-committee, a report of their
views on education. It is, of course, disputed whether
Talleyrand wrote the speech. Some attribute it to
Chamfort, others to Condorcet, others to des Renaudes.
Talleyrand distinctly claims it, acknowledging his debt
to the chief savants of the time&mdash;Lagrange, Lavoisier,
Laplace, Monge, Condorcet, Vicq d’Azir, la Harpe, and
others. It is, in fact, a most remarkable presentation of
the best opinions of the time, united in a brilliant scheme
of national education. We know that Talleyrand had a
habit of writing a heap of scrappy notes and leaving it
to his secretary to unite them: just as M. de Bacourt
has done with the memoirs. In this sense the finished
manuscript is possibly the work of des Renaudes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
but the vast and striking scheme is a construction of
Talleyrand’s. Long before, Morris had said that education
was “the bee in Talleyrand’s bonnet.”</p>

<p>He begins with a ruthless account of the pre-Revolutionary
education, and makes an appeal to the
Assembly to complete its work with a worthy system of
national instruction. Education must be universal, free,
the same for both sexes (this he modifies presently), and
must regard adults as well as children. It must include
lessons on religion, but its lessons in morality and civism
must be completely separated from these, and purely
humanitarian. Thinkers must be invited to draw up
manuals for this most important section of the code.
The organisation must correspond to the civic organisation.
The primary schools must be under the control
of the elementary political division. Secondary schools
must be set up by the District, technical schools by the
Department, and there must be a great central Institute
at Paris. The State must provide all primary education,
and it must found and assist higher schools, but in
these the pupil must contribute; though the State will
see that poverty does not exclude able youths. Girls
will have equal instruction with boys in the primary
schools, and a few higher schools will be provided for
them, but the home must be their chief school (this is
put in rather awkwardly towards the close). The
construction of the scheme must proceed slowly and
cautiously. No children under seven shall attend
school. The work of the technical or special schools is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
very fully discussed. First amongst them he puts
“schools of theology,” and in these the subtleties of the
older theology shall be avoided, and a solid, rational
Christian doctrine expounded. There is not a shade of
offence to old ideas or colleagues in the phrasing. The
work of the medical, legal, and military schools is
similarly analysed. The Institute, for which he makes
a stirring appeal, is to have the first professors in France
and the best laboratories and equipment; it shall have
branches all over the country. Public libraries must be
built in connection with all higher schools. The French
language is to be purified and strengthened. National
fêtes shall be designed by artists and scientists, and form
part of the great scheme of uplifting the people.</p>

<p>Jules Simon has described this speech as “at once
a law and a book,” and Renan says it is “the most
remarkable theory of public instruction that has ever
been propounded in France.” It is certainly a wonderful
vision, in its general outline, of the education of
the future. No doubt thinkers and reformers of all
schools were working for a reform of education. The
clergy themselves were prepared on the eve of the
States-General to respond to the demand for progress.
But only a few in France were fully acquainted with
the views of the expert thinkers, and Talleyrand did a
fine piece of work in thus presenting them. Unfortunately,
a firework of applause was all that he could
obtain. The subject was deferred&mdash;for ten years, as it
turned out. The sadly imperfect education of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
earlier regime was succeeded by the complete absence of
it during the Revolution. Talleyrand had to wait for
the genius of Napoleon to make a beginning with his
scheme. It is growing near to realization in the
twentieth century.</p>

<p>On the 30th of September the Constituent
Assembly broke up. It had at length completed the
constitution. Those who think lightly of its work,
who see only its constitution-committee, and that on
its vulnerable side, may be asked to conceive France
without it during those two years and a half; as well
try to conceive Paris in some order without Lafayette
and his National Guard. But what it did, and what
its constitution was worth, and how anarchy had grown
too strong before it was given&mdash;all these things are told
in the larger story of the Revolution. One thing it
did that affected Talleyrand. It bound its members
to refrain from taking office or commission or gift or
pension for two years. “Greenish” Robespierre had
proposed this. As a consequence the nation was
deprived of the service of its most trained and expert
governors and administrators. A special gallery was
appointed from which they might witness the proceedings
of the new Legislative Assembly, and be able
to afford friendly hints in private; but a vast amount
of talent was wasted at a critical period. So slow and
delicate had been the transfer of executive power, so
dazzling the new ideal of liberty to the emancipated,
so strong and daring the self-assertion of mobs, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
skilled the art of the demagogue, that the air was thick
with dangers. It would need all the sound heads and
steady arms in France to launch that new Constitution
safely on such waters; and they began by turning the
majority of the soundest and steadiest away.</p>

<p>Talleyrand, with ever mistier prospect in front, did
what he could in the next three months. The Girondists
had quickly come to power in the new Assembly,
decreed death and confiscation against emigrants, and
pronounced expulsion against all priests who would not
take the oath. They then asked the Department of
Paris to furnish a list of suspected priests, but it refused
to do so. Talleyrand and several other of its members
even went on to beg the King not to sanction the decree
of November 29th against the non-swearing priests. The
sections at Paris unsuccessfully demanded their impeachment
for the letter. Later, in December, we find him
prevailing upon the Department to pay the salaries of
the non-juring priests. It is his last official act before
he leaves France. But the significance of these two acts
should not be neglected. At a time when the more
violent are seizing power, our excommunicated bishop&mdash;our
“Judas,” and all the rest&mdash;with no position, exerts
himself to rescue from them his most bitter opponents.</p>

<p>But Talleyrand had now completed the first part of
his career, and was about to enter the path of diplomacy.
Paris became less attractive every month. He began to
think of foreign embassies. No doubt these also were
forbidden by the September decree, but in regard to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
these at least it was possible to evade the measure.
Moreover, war had at length been decided on, and
Talleyrand would be of use in keeping England neutral.
Early in December we find an active correspondence
going on between Talleyrand, Narbonne (now Minister
of War) and de Biron (formally Lauzun). Talleyrand,
in the capital, is evidently in close touch with the new
Ministry, and not without influence over de Lessart.
De Biron is pressed to take up military command; he
in turn suggests that an ambassador should be sent to
London. Talleyrand proposes De Biron himself, who
knows London well. De Biron cannot be spared from
the army, and suggests Talleyrand. De Lessart, the
Minister, presses him to accept, and in January he starts
for England, with an informal diplomatic mission.</p>

<p>Talleyrand left his country, but not Paris, with
reluctance. The Paris he had so much enjoyed up to
1789 was changed, desecrated, beyond endurance.
Closed now were most of the fine salons where he
had played and talked. Hardly could a Mme. de Staël
and a few survivors restore some faint gleam of the
faded brilliance. Even her, with all her devotion to
him and her great helpfulness, he never loved. “I
believe we are both in it, disguised as women,” he
said, with piercing cruelty, of the novel in which she
afterwards depicted their relations.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> Apart from one
or two houses, Paris was getting insufferable. Ugliness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>vulgarity, strident pedantry of the ignorant sort, followed
one everywhere. Your servant, sweeping the salon
while you spoke to your visitor, could join in the
conversation. “Who? Montmorin? He’s a scoundrel,”
interrupted one, while his mistress and visitor were
discussing the late minister. The drawing-rooms of
new Paris were hung with blatant caricatures. Ladies
wore the tricolour even in the shape of boots. Jewellery
had been replaced by bits of Bastille stone. Some
wore red dresses, of the shade “Foulon’s blood.” The
graceful furniture of the preceding generation was
replaced by pseudo-classic of the crudest sort.</p>

<p>Abroad there was no chance of eluding the growing
coarseness without hearing the word “aristocroc,” if not
“lanterne.” Old titles had been abolished, as well as
armorial bearings. Now “thou” and “thee” were
being thought patriotic; the fashion would presently be
enforced by law. Patriots of the more thorough kind
were discovering that it was beneath the dignity of a man
to raise his hat, or bow, or be polite in the old fashion.
From equality they were passing on to that idea of
fraternity which Chamfort&mdash;who was venting lurid
phrases in the middle of it all&mdash;described as: “Be my
brother, or I’ll kill thee.” Solicitation on the streets or
at the Palais became disgusting. <i>Coureur des filles</i> had
been a term of reproach in the day of <i>liaisons</i>. Now
60,000 of them, most of them about 14 or 15 years old,
calculated to be making an income of 143,000,000 a year,
held the city. Caricatures and pamphlets became grosser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
every week, the press more strident and hysterical.
Every wall was covered with gaudy placards. Even
classic dramas were altered to suit the patriotic taste.</p>

<p>From such a picture the refined noble, to whom the
supreme virtue was taste, turned wearily away. At the
same time it did seem probable that he could be very
useful at London. Pitt’s bias for peace was known, as
well as the sympathy of Fox and the Opposition. But
the emigrants were employing every fair and foul means
in their power to alarm and alienate England. For
France its neutrality, at least, was supremely important
in face of the inevitable war on the continent. Pitt,
Grenville and Dundas, were known to be favourable; but
Camden, Thurlow, and especially the King, were very
unfavourably disposed. So, urging de Lessart to fix up
the fleet&mdash;“one must talk to the northern powers with
an army, and to England with a fleet”&mdash;Talleyrand
departed for London, which he reached on January 24th.</p>

<p>His difficulties began before he arrived. He was
delayed at the coast for a day, and so did not reach
London at the appointed time. But the London press
had announced his arrival, all the same, and added that
he had been badly received by Pitt. It was the opening
of the subterranean campaign of his former friends, now
needy and embittered emigrants, at London. Pitt, as
a matter of fact, received him with the utmost politeness,
but nothing more. He reminded Talleyrand of
their earlier meeting at Rheims, and declared his
satisfaction at being able to discuss the situation in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
France with one so well informed, but said that
Talleyrand’s unofficial character prevented him from
going any further. Talleyrand was, of course, really
holding an official and salaried appointment, but no
action could be taken that might expose this to the
keen scent of the patriots at home. He had to pursue
his task with double diplomacy, and he succeeded very
well until the Terror made England recoil. He saw
the King on February 1st, and was received with frigid
correctness; the Queen would not speak to him. He
then saw Lord Grenville. For three-quarters of an
hour he held Grenville listening to an explanation of
the situation, politely suppressing all his attempts to
speak, and postponing his answer. But Grenville could
only follow Pitt’s example. He intimated plainly
enough to Citizen Talleyrand in his private capacity
that England strongly desired peace, but he could make
no official communication to him. Beyond this Talleyrand
could do nothing with the Government. It seemed
to have a surprising respect for the decree of the
Constituent Assembly which said that Talleyrand <i>must</i>
be a private individual. Talleyrand did not appreciate
such virtue. However, he really did a good deal with
Grenville in the way of arranging the details of the
understanding between the two countries.</p>

<p>On the other hand Talleyrand neglected no
opportunity of cultivating English society. When we
find him in 1802 instructing the French representative
at London to accept all invitations and make frequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
attendance at the Exchange (“there is nearly always a
Minister about”) we can see his own conduct of 1792.
He became very friendly with Lord Lansdowne, and
was, naturally, warmly welcomed by Fox, Sheridan, and
their party. His chief first impression of England was
its slowness; it is more curious to find that this was the
chief impression he himself made on his hosts. This
was owing to the reputation of his gay life in the
eighties, which had preceded him, and partly to the
ineradicable English idea of the French character. No
doubt there was some excuse for it in those days.
England had listened with open mouth to the news of
the grand pyrotechnic displays of French emotion in
1790 and 1791. The reports had not lost colour in
crossing the Channel. Journalism and caricature and
Burke-oratory had effectively conveyed them to the
British imagination. Emigrant conduct during the same
period would doubtless confirm the idea that the
Frenchman was a bundle of doubly-charged nerves. To
these stolid fathers of ours with such an expectation the
person of Talleyrand was a mystery. One of the gayest
figures of pre-Revolutionary days, with a reputation for
keenest wit and brilliant <i>mots</i>, and now hot from the
crater of the volcano, he was expected to dance and
gesticulate and emit electric phrases. Instead they
were introduced to a pale, sedate, stolid-looking man,
who hardly opened his mouth after the first quiet and
brief courtesies were over. With closer friends
Talleyrand enjoyed himself in the old way. But he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
wore a diplomatic sedateness on ordinary occasions; and
his puffy, rounded face and full figure, his perfect ease
and quietness of bearing, and his deep, slow, sententious
speech, disconcerted people.</p>

<p>In his letters to de Lessart he shows that his
feelings were lively enough beneath this exterior.
What with provincial risings and foreign threats and
Jacobin violence, poor de Lessart was too distracted to
pay adequate attention to Talleyrand’s mission, and the
letters to him are impatient. “Kill each other or
embrace,” urged Talleyrand, when he heard of the
quarrels at Paris. Moreover, his companion in London
had gravely compromised him. Narbonne had given
de Biron a commission to buy horses in England for
the army, and he accompanied Talleyrand in January.
His real purpose was to introduce Talleyrand in
London society, with which he was familiar&mdash;unfortunately,
too familiar; he was arrested for debt shortly
after they landed. De Biron swears the bills were
forged, and others talk of emigrant plots. The truth
seems to be that he gambled very heavily at the London
clubs. At these places the stewards obliged the players
with loans, at a good discount. De Biron, dreaming of
easy-going Paris, where there were no debtors’ prisons,
was a good customer. Between former visits and the
present one he owed about £16,000. Some of his
creditors closed, and the Colonel found himself in the
King’s Bench. French visitors often failed to realise
the new conditions. The Count d’Artois had only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
escaped imprisonment by seeking sanctuary at Holyrood.
Talleyrand, greatly annoyed, employed Erskine
to dispute the bills or raise the plea of “privilege,” but
he failed on both counts. Lauzun was eventually
bought out by Lord Rawdon and a French admirer,
and retired in a violent passion to France. The episode
was not lost on the emigrants and French libellists,
whose spicy contributions to the London press were
appreciated. A further source of annoyance was that
the <i>Times</i> made a violent attack on Talleyrand, on the
ground of his constant intercourse with the Opposition
and, it alleged, with such men as Tooke and Paine.
There is a letter from one of their secret agents to
the French Government which says that the English
Ministers were annoyed at Talleyrand’s relations with
the Opposition, but it adds that his culture and dignity
have made a good impression in England.</p>

<p>Talleyrand now thought it would be better to have
a nominal ambassador at the Court, through whom he
could act with greater effect, and he crossed over to
Paris in March to persuade de Lessart. That Minister
had disappeared when he arrived (March 10th), but he
convinced his successor, Dumouriez, of the importance
of the matter, and returned to London (April 29th) with
three companions (besides des Renaudes, who had been
with him all along). Talleyrand had asked for the young
Marquis de Chauvelin as ambassador. Duroveray, who
knew England, was appointed in much the same position
as Talleyrand, and Reinhard was secretary. The long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
instructions which were given them, directing them to
press for an alliance, or at least for perfect neutrality,
and to negotiate a loan with England’s credit, and in
return for the island of Tobago, were either written by
Talleyrand or from his notes. He intended to leave
very little to his <i>prête-nom</i>; who, unfortunately, intended
to do very much. The idea had been to appoint a
competent nonentity. Chauvelin proved both incompetent
and self-assertive enough to harass Talleyrand.
His luggage was opened at the custom-house and found
to contain contraband goods. The hostile press was
not impressed by the new embassy. Tory shops in
Piccadilly exhibited strong caricatures of Talleyrand.
But such insinuations as this were grossly misplaced.
Talleyrand had, as a member of the diplomatic committee
at Paris, fought successfully against the demand
for a revolutionary propaganda abroad, and he censured
very severely the conduct of one or two ambassadors
who obtruded their republicanism at Foreign Courts.
But, besides the incompetence of Chauvelin&mdash;who was
once sharply pulled up by Lord Grenville for his
language, when he had boldly acted without Talleyrand&mdash;a
great deal of mischief was done by the press on both
sides. This letter of Lord Grenville’s was published in
the emigrant papers, and the King’s private letter to
George III was published almost before it was delivered.
The Parisian journals, on the other hand, were full of
tactless and irritating announcements of an impending
revolution in England, and attacks on the King and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
Ministers. Few but members of the Opposition would
now entertain the French envoys. On one occasion,
when they went in a body to Ranelagh, they were most
ostentatiously shunned by the whole crowd. English
spies were constantly at their heels. Exaggerated
reports of events in France were circulated, and
Talleyrand was left without any official information.
He complained bitterly to Dumouriez of their “painful
and embarrassing situation.”<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>But, in spite of all the difficulties, Talleyrand
succeeded very well. If an alliance was concluded with
England, Austria would reflect a little longer before
interfering in French affairs; hence the desperate
intrigues of the royalists to prevent such alliance. On
the other hand, the continental coalition against France
was strengthening the anti-French elements in England.
At the beginning of May Prussia made overtures to
England. Pitt rejected them, and stood firm for
neutrality. On May 25th he was induced to have a public
declaration made of neutrality, and Talleyrand scored
his first diplomatic triumph. He does not forget to tell
Dumouriez that it would be well if his (Talleyrand’s)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>name were mentioned in the Paris journals. But
Dumouriez was exacting. He pressed for an alliance,
and for explicit statements as to England’s position if
the war in Belgium led to a conflict with Holland.
Talleyrand kept his position skilfully between the two
Governments, each now impelled by a heated nation, but,
in June the French Ministry was again broken up and
Dumouriez dismissed. A few days later came the news
of the invasion of the Tuileries. A private letter from
the Duke de la Rochefoucauld warned Talleyrand of
the grave development in Paris, and appealed to him
to come over and strengthen the Department of Paris,
of which he was still a member.</p>

<p>On July 5th Talleyrand again set out for Paris.
He had immediately (June 22nd) applied to the Foreign
Minister for leave of absence for a fortnight, in order to
come and confer with him at Paris. His real purpose
was to study the latest development of the situation.
The King was now a mere puppet in the hands of the
people; and, without army, France had declared war on
Europe. Talleyrand, with a sigh, went over to study
this latest phase, and wonder what the abyss would
produce next. It proved to be the close of his first
diplomatic mission.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">EXILE</span></p>


<p>Talleyrand arrived at Paris just in time to witness the
last weak struggle of order against anarchy. Lafayette
had flown back to Paris, had fruitlessly appealed to the
Legislative Assembly against the Jacobins, had just as
fruitlessly appealed to lawless order against lawless
disorder, and had retired in despair to his army. However,
the Department of Paris, which still represented
the orderly and stable elements of the city, had
suspended the Mayor, Pétion, the day after Talleyrand
left London. The forest of pikes glistened in the
streets once more, and the Legislative Assembly was
forced to restore Pétion to office and abandon the
Department. Talleyrand, la Rochefoucauld, and other
moderates, then resigned their positions, and awaited
the next step of the mob and the Jacobins. The
following day was the anniversary of the fall of the
Bastille, and though it passed quietly Talleyrand would
observe the fiercer attitude of the crowd and its
emblems. He and la Rochefoucauld were passing
under the balcony of the Tuileries that evening when
the Queen nodded to them. Talleyrand must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
made his own reflections on this; also on the unpleasant
spirit it at once provoked in the crowd.</p>

<p>Talleyrand lingered beyond his fortnight. The
atmosphere was sultry, electric. Something would
happen soon&mdash;something graver than all the grave rest.
Provincial petitions began to trickle in praying for the
deposition of the King. On August 3rd Mayor Pétion
comes openly, at the head of the municipal officers in
their tricolour scarves, to demand it of the Assembly.
The fiery Marseillais have arrived; fiery troops are
pouring in from all parts of France. The official
declaration that “the country is in danger” has
strengthened the Jacobins. On the 8th of August the
Assembly refuse to condemn Lafayette, and its refusing
majority is hunted by the crowd. On the 9th it must
discuss the question of the deposition of the King. It
can come to no resolution, and sits wavering between
the pale ghost of loyalty and the city of pikes. That
night the insurrection becomes fully conscious of its
power. At sunrise the grim flood surges again about
the walls and flows over the terraces and through the
outer gates of the Tuileries. The Swiss guards are
provoked into firing, and within a few hours nearly
2,000 lie dead. Paris has tasted blood now with fearful
effect. It has 1,200 patriots to avenge. The King is
“suspended”; a National Convention is summoned,
with no restriction whatever on electors or candidates.<br /><br /></p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus_151.jpg" width="400" height="553" alt="" />
<p class="caption">DANTON.</p></div>

<p>What Talleyrand thought at this time we do not
know, but we can confidently assume. The last particle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>of his constitutional ideal was disappearing. Still he
clung to France for a few days. Danton, now all-powerful
as Minister of Justice, had been his colleague
in the Department, and seems to have been not indifferent
to him. Something might yet be done. They
induced him to write a defence of the events of the
10th to pacify England. This document&mdash;which must
be admitted to come from Talleyrand’s pen&mdash;has been
gravely censured. It is certainly a desperate appeal,
but, save for an odd phrase that is diplomatically exaggerated,
is not indefensible. We can well imagine
what the French papers in London were making of the
10th. Talleyrand, in the name of the new executive
(bound to defend its supporters), put the other side of
the matter. He strongly, but justly, criticises the
conduct of the royal family, as being seriously provocative.
The only downright injustice is when he speaks
of the Swiss guards as the “cowardly satellites” of the
monarchy. Lady Blennerhassett thinks this unpardonable.
It is certainly a harsh phrase to write over men
who died a brave and noble death, but the truth is that
many of them were encouraging the crowd to advance
when the others (unknown to them very probably)
began their deadly fire.</p>

<p>Lady Blennerhassett sees a grave inconsistency,
inspired by a base motive, in Talleyrand’s protesting
against the affair of June 20th, and then condoning the
worse attack of August 10th and siding with the
Jacobins. We must remember that many things had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
happened since July 13th. Hostile armies hung
threateningly on the frontier; one must take desperate
measures now to secure the continued neutrality of
England. Further, on July 13th it was not at all
certain that the Jacobins could not be checked; it was
now clear that one must work with them or through
them, or desert the country to its fate, for no human
judgment, not patriotically intoxicated, could see how
Prussia, Austria and Brunswick were to be held off.
It is a sheer perversion of history to say that Talleyrand
deserted the King after August 10th. He had deserted
his <i>cause</i> long ago; his <i>person</i>, his life and liberty,
Talleyrand never willingly saw endangered; nor did
he ever cease to be a partisan of limited monarchy.
It is, indeed, a question if the events of August 10th
did not put the royalist cause in a more hopeful plight.
Certainly the royalists thought so. These events
doubled the pace of the armies that were heading
towards Paris. Finally, it is quite impossible to see
that Talleyrand expected any advantage out of the
new administration.</p>

<p>Briefly, then, Talleyrand was perfectly consistent in
writing the official “explanation” of August 10th. One
would imagine from some of the references to it that it
was a blatantly patriotic boast of the affair; one need
only recollect that it was written by an astute diplomatist
to a well-informed country, and for a strictly conciliatory
purpose. It merely pointed out the extenuating features
of the “terrible events” with diplomatic casuistry. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
must not judge Talleyrand as if he had ever believed in
the divine right of Kings. Nor had he any particular
grounds of personal loyalty to King or Queen; nor can
he be accused of untruth in laying on the royalist cause
the burden of the Austrian and Prussian invasions.</p>

<p>But Lady Blennerhassett is herself unpardonable
when she says Talleyrand’s destiny “dragged him deeper
still, into the bloody torrent of the September massacres.”
This is a most unhappy way of expressing the fact that
Talleyrand was a disgusted spectator of those awful
scenes, and that he fled the country as soon as they
happened. We lose sight of him from August 18th,
when he penned the diplomatic defence of Danton, until
September 14th. On that day Barrère finds him leaving
Danton’s room in travelling dress with a passport for
London.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> Danton had sent his friend Noel to London
to supersede Chauvelin and keep England neutral. At
the beginning of September Noel had written to say that
negotiations seemed possible (August 10th had evidently
not been regarded as inexcusable at London), and Danton
had thought the conditions suggested were not inacceptable.
Meantime, the hostile forces were converging
successfully on Paris. On August 29th comes terrible
news of Prussians, Austrians and Brunswick, and of the
rising in La Vendée. There are not weapons, when
even women offer to bear them. Danton gets an order
for a visitation of suspected houses and incarceration of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>suspects. Royalists are leading every invading army.
Paris is in the last stage of the new “intoxication.”
The awful story of the first week of September has been
told often enough. By Thursday evening Talleyrand
would hear that more than a thousand men and women,
mostly innocent, had been savagely murdered. The
next day he obtained from Danton a passport: “Leave
to pass to Citizen Talleyrand, going to London by our
order.”</p>

<p>The last phase of the movement he had followed
since May 6th, 1789, was too repulsive. He could
say no longer that “provided he remained French, he
was prepared for anything.” He was not prepared for
murder. His one thought was to leave France. On
the pretext of a mission to persuade England to adopt
the metrical system he received permission to leave.
Research in the archives of the Foreign Office has
brought to light (says M. Pallain) a letter in which
Talleyrand asks permission to return and continue his
work in London before the end of August, when the
guillotine had already begun its work. He did not,
therefore wait until there was personal danger before
he fled. He did not cling to ruling powers until their
long lists were drawn up. However, he would probably
have less difficulty than is supposed in securing permission
to leave from Danton. It was more than
ever imperative to have an able man in London. The
British Ambassador, like all others, had fled from Paris.
Noel had to face a storm of indignation in England.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
Danton would, one imagines, see no more useful man
in the emergency than Talleyrand. However that may
be, he left Paris on September 14th, not to return
until the long story of the reign of violence was over.
His “real aim” was, he says, to get away from France;
but he applied for a passport so as not to close the
door behind him in the event of his wishing to return.</p>

<p>He arrived in England on the 23rd, only to find,
as he expected, his whole diplomatic work in sad danger.
He announced his arrival to the Foreign Office, denying
that he had any mission, but expressing his readiness
to give information. He was not invited to give any.
A good deal has been written on the question whether
he had a mission or no, but the solution is hardly
obscure when all the evidence is read. While denying
in England (and even in a letter to Danton) that he
had any mission, he told several correspondents that
he had, and in his later petition from America he claimed
that he was enjoined to prevent a rupture between
England and France. The conflict of evidence is
easily reconciled if we suppose he had an informal,
secret understanding to that effect with Danton. It
is the most likely thing to happen in the circumstances.
In any case he had not long to continue his delicate
task. The Opposition in England was prepared to
support him to very great lengths, even after the
triumphant Jacobins at Paris had decreed a war of
revolutionary propaganda. Talleyrand always regarded
this as a fatal step, and he even now wrote to Paris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
to counteract the feeling. The very able memorandum
“On the actual relations of France to the other States
of Europe,” which he forwarded to Lebrun, now Chief
Minister, and to several members of the Convention,
has been published by Pallain. It is a finely-written
and sober political document. To the new idea of
French dominance he replies that “the only useful and
reasonable dominance, the only one that becomes free
and enlightened men, is to be master of one’s self,
and never to make the ridiculous pretention to domineer
over others.” It is time that a mature France had
done with illusions. An understanding with free
nations, for peaceful, commercial purposes, should be
the ideal. Wars of aggrandisement should be condemned.
It is a very sincere and admirable political
gospel.</p>

<p>By a curious chance it must have reached Paris<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>
just before the Convention began to discuss the question
of putting its author on the list of emigrants, forbidden
to return under pain of death. A letter had been found
amongst the King’s papers, in which Laporte, the King’s
steward, had reported (in April, 1791) that Talleyrand
was anxious to serve him. On the strength of this letter
condemnation was passed on December 5th, and
Talleyrand was made an exile. A letter, signed D.
(probably from des Renaudes, but possibly Danton), was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>inserted in the <i>Moniteur</i> in defence of Talleyrand. It
appealed to the minister Lebrun, and others to whom
Talleyrand had sent his patriotic memorandum a few
days before, to produce this proof of his loyalty.
Talleyrand himself wrote a letter to the <i>Gazette</i> in which
he flatly denied that he had any relations whatever with
the King or Laporte. He claimed that the only particle
of truth on which one could make such a statement was
that he had written a report in defence of freedom of
worship (which we have considered, dated May 7th,
1791), in which he upheld the King’s right to the
ministration of a non-juring priest. Laporte, he said,
must have seen this memorandum as it circulated
privately&mdash;as so many speeches did&mdash;before May 7th,
and interpreted it to mean that Talleyrand favoured
the King. It is likely enough, and at all events we have
no further evidence. But the defence was of no avail.
Talleyrand remained on the proscribed list for three
years.</p>

<p>It is not probable that Talleyrand would have
ventured again to live at Paris during those years. He
<i>was</i> an aristocrat, even if he clothed himself from head
to foot in tricolour. He was a man of refined and
humane temper, and could not possibly have co-operated
further with the sanguinary parties that now came to
power. At the most he would wish to retain a distant
connection in the event of an improvement in the
condition of Paris. A few days after reaching London,
in accepting an invitation to Bowood, he wrote to Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
Lansdowne that “when one has passed the last two
months at Paris one needs to come and refresh oneself
with the conversation of superior people.” Then came
news of the impeachment and trial of the King.
London listened with growing horror and disgust to the
details of the “trial.” On January 21st Louis was
guillotined. On January 24th the late French ambassador,
Chauvelin, the only official-looking Frenchman the
Government could find, was swept out of England. On
February 1st the Convention declared war against
England and Holland (the one entanglement that endangered
England’s neutrality). Talleyrand found the door
which he had so cleverly contrived to leave open
violently slammed upon him.</p>

<p>He says in the memoirs that he did not intend
to stay long in England. In fact, we know now
that he applied about this time for permission to settle
in Tuscany, but the Grand Duke had to refuse on the
ground of his neutrality. The position must have been
trying for a man of Talleyrand’s taste and ambition. If
we may trust his later observations, his mind wandered
unsteadily from one country to another and one occupation
to another. He settled down, however, to the
life of an emigrant in London, and managed to spend a
year not unpleasantly. His library had been transferred
to London,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> and he spent his mornings in writing. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>does not tell us the subject, but says that when he had
returned to France a huge mass of his notes and
memoranda came over from London. He would have
us believe that they proved of little use for the writing
of his memoirs, but the chapter on the Duc d’Orléans
is so ample and circumstantial that it seems to have been
written at an early date, and was not improbably written
in 1793. It affords a thorough reply to the rumours, for
which no documentary ground has ever been discovered
by his most bitter enemies, that he was secretly working
with the Orleanist group. He did not frequent the
Palais Royal in a political capacity.</p>

<p>But in spite of emigrant hatred and the general
British hostility to France, he found a sufficiently large
social circle in London. Mme. de Genlis had come
to England with her niece. Talleyrand offered her a
little money out of his small fund, and actually did assist
other compatriots. Many of them were, as is known,
living in bitter poverty. Mme. de Staël came over in
January and remained until the summer. She took a
house near Richmond, and Talleyrand spent a good deal
of his time there. In Kensington the Countess de la
Châtre kept a house, where many of Talleyrand’s old
friends met. Narbonne had with difficulty got away&mdash;with
the assistance of Mme. de Staël and Talleyrand&mdash;at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>the beginning of September. Rivarol and Lalley-Tollendal
and many other constitutionalists were there.
Fox and Sheridan and their friends afforded a fairly
large circle of English acquaintances. Lord Lansdowne
continued friendly long after he left England. At his
house Talleyrand speaks of frequently meeting Hastings,
Price, Priestley, Romilly, and Jeremy Bentham. His
reputation for culture and conversation opened many
doors. Sydney Smith was brought in contact with
him somewhere, and says that he found him unequal to
his reputation; but one imagines that Sydney Smith
would not be unbiassed, and he admits he could not
understand his French. The German physician,
Bollmann, found him so charming that he “could listen
to him for years.” On the whole, Talleyrand fared
better than most of his indigent companions, though the
enforced idleness annoyed him. “Patience and sleep,”
he told Mme. de Staël, was his programme for the
present. In another letter he described his chief occupations
as “fishing and correcting proofs” (of Mme.
de Flahaut’s novel).</p>

<p>It is from the letters he wrote to Mme. de Staël
after her return to France that we find he is still
watching the situation in that country without despair.
In one letter he sketches a plan. The southern
provinces, which still show some attachment to the
constitution, should unite, and invite the members of
the old Constituent Assembly to meet at Toulon. He
believes that the nation is still attached to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>constitution, and that it is really in the supposed defence
of this that they have risen against King and invaders.
When he hears of the execution of the Queen he has to
modify his view. “It is all over with the house of
Bourbon in France,” he says; but he never believed that
France would remain permanently republican. His
wistful speculations, which were equally resented by
republicans in France and royalists out of it (who
charged the constitutionalists with bringing all his
misfortunes on the King), were cut short at the
beginning of 1794 by a peremptory order to quit
England within five days (in another place Talleyrand
says twenty-four hours).<br /><br /></p>

<p class="caption">MADAME DE STAËL.</p></div>



<p>The order was inexcusable, but no influence that
Talleyrand could command had any effect on it. A law
had been passed twelve months before empowering the
Government to expel undesirable aliens, and it had been
applied to Noel and Chauvelin. Talleyrand may have
feared its extension to him at first, when he applied for
residence in Tuscany, but he was not prepared for this
cruel application after twelve months of peaceful life in
London. He pressed his most influential friends to
obtain some explanation, at least, of the order, but none
was given. In the end, he attributed it to intrigues of
his emigrant enemies, and one can see no other reason
for it. He was the only distinguished Frenchman of
moderate views to incur the order. Sainte-Beuve says
it “proves he was not in the odour of virtue.” It, at
all events, proved, if this needed proof, that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
enemies. He protested to Pitt and to the King,
but it was no use, and he took ship for America on
February 3rd. His letters to Lord Lansdowne and
Mme. de Staël show a very natural bitterness of feeling,
but even at this time he hardly blamed England. But
when the ship was detained at Greenwich he refused an
invitation from Dundas to spend the time at his house,
saying that he could not set foot on English soil again
after receiving such an order.</p>

<p>The romantic biographers have enlivened his voyage
with adventures. They tell how the Dutch vessel in
which he sailed was stopped and searched by an English
frigate, and Talleyrand dressed himself in the cook’s
clothes to pass the scrutiny. M. Michaud, as usual,
does not deign to mention his authority. Talleyrand
only says that the ship was beaten back by heavy storms,
and seemed at one time in danger of being driven on
the French coast. It did put in at Falmouth for repairs,
and Talleyrand landed there, so that his objection to
English soil was relaxing. He was told that an American
general was staying at an inn in the town, and he found
that it was General Arnold, who would hardly give him
an attractive picture of his future home. Whether it
was from this conversation, or from a real weariness of
spirit (or, in fine, a freak of memory in later years), he
says that he did not want to leave ship when they
reached Philadelphia. Another ship was sailing out as
they reached the mouth of the Delaware, and he sent a
boat to learn its destination. It was going to Calcutta,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
and he wanted, he says, to take a berth in it, but
could not get one. He landed at Philadelphia with his
companions, M. de Beaumetz and des Renaudes,
towards the end of March.</p>

<p>A number of acquaintances had preceded him to
America. When the emigration began people recollected
the lively stories brought back by Lafayette and his
companions, and many who either had wealth or wanted
to make it sailed to the States. At Philadelphia,
Talleyrand found a Dutchman named Casenove, whom
he had known at Paris, and who now proved useful
to him. There were half-a-dozen emigrants in
Philadelphia, and they met at nights over gay but
frugal suppers, at the house of Moreau-Saint-Méry, who
had opened a book-store there. Michaud says Talleyrand
opened a store for the sale of night-caps; the
legend probably grew out of a curious custom of
Talleyrand’s of wearing several of these at night. But
Talleyrand was evidently very restless and irritated.
Washington declined to grant him a formal interview,
and Talleyrand refused, as he says, to go to see him
by the back door. The only man whose friendship
relieved the depression of that time was Colonel
Alexander Hamilton, whom Talleyrand describes as
the ablest statesman then living, not excepting Pitt and
Fox. They had long conversations on political and
economic subjects, and were happily agreed on most
matters; though Hamilton was a moderate Protectionist
and Talleyrand a strong Free-trader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>

<p>Talleyrand sought some relief by a voyage into
the interior with Beaumetz and a Dutch friend,
Heydecooper. He was not insensible to the natural
beauty of the forests and prairies, which he describes
with unusual literary care, but he was chiefly impressed
with the vast possibilities of these leagues of uncultivated
territory. Within a few miles of every sea-coast
town you plunged into virgin forests, and from the
hill-tops you looked over illimitable oceans of wild
growth. A thoughtful traveller like Talleyrand could
not but speculate on the future of the country. Convinced
as he was of the primary importance of agriculture,
the future of America had a peculiar interest
for him. But as he wandered from town to town, and
saw more of the people, he felt some disappointment
in them. The idealist fervour which he expected to
find still glowing, within a few years of the declaration
of independence, seemed to be wholly extinct. In fact,
if Talleyrand had been able to anticipate that elegant
phrase, he would have said “making their pile” was the
chief preoccupation of the Americans of 1794. Without
bitterness, but with something like sadness, he tells a
number of stories about his experience. He met a
fairly rich man in one town who had never been to
Philadelphia. He would like to see Washington, the
man assented to Talleyrand’s inquiry, but he would very
much rather see Bingham, who was reported to be very
wealthy. At another place he noticed that his host
put his hat&mdash;a hat that a Parisian stable-boy would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
wear, he says&mdash;on a beautiful table of Sèvres porcelain
brought from the Trianon. When Talleyrand speaks
impatiently of America as “a country without a past,”
he is thinking of these incongruities; there had not
yet been time in the history of America for the fixing
of inviolable canons. In some other respects the
features of life in this new country were amusing. In
a log cabin on the Ohio they found some good bronzes
and a fine piano. When Beaumetz opened it, however,
the owner had to ask him to spare them; the nearest
tuner lived a hundred miles away, and had not called
that year.</p>

<p>Talleyrand makes it clear that he understands how
these features of American life are inseparable from its
newness and its pioneering character, but he feels the
discord too keenly to enjoy it on its adventurous and
picturesque sides. “If I have to stay here another year
I shall die,” he wrote to Mme. de Staël. He appreciates
the sincerity of their religious life after that of pre-Revolutionary
Paris, but a country of thirty-two
religions and only one sauce does not suit him. He
wrote a long letter to Lord Lansdowne (February 1st,
1795), with the view of bringing about a better
understanding between England and America. The
independence of the States is settled for ever, he
says; there is no question whatever of a reversion
to the status of a British colony. Nevertheless,
though feeling is at present averted from England
and turning towards France, the link between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
two nations is strong and natural. All the institutions
of America and all its economic features (which
he discusses at great length) compel it to look in
friendly interest to England. In June and July he
sent other brief notes to Lord Lansdowne. In June,
moreover, he heard of the rout of the Jacobins at Paris.
In the memoirs he affirms (and the most indulgent
admiration fails to ascribe <i>this</i> to a freak of memory) that
the National Convention rescinded the decree against
him “without any request on my part.” We have a
copy of the petition he wrote to the Convention on
June 16th, pressing for the removal of his name from
the proscribed list. He urges that the reasons for
putting him on the list were frivolous, but he had not
been able to return to Paris to contest them, because
“under the tyranny of Robespierre” the prisons were
violated, and he would be executed without trial. It is
probably about the same time that he wrote to Mme.
de Staël, who quotes his words in a later letter to him.</p>

<p>Whether Talleyrand despaired of obtaining permission
to return he does not say, but he tells us that
in the autumn of 1795 he and his friend Beaumetz
invested their small capital in stocking a ship for
the East Indies. They had seen the first American
adventurers return from India in 1794 with rich
spoils, and seem to have caught the Indian fever that
then broke out in America. They were joined by
a number of Philadelphia firms, and their ship was
about to start when the Fates intervened. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
the biography of Talleyrand would have run if this
adventure had been permitted it is difficult to conjecture.
In fact, the whole story has a most undeniable odour
of legend about it, but, apart from a few details (such
as that of Beaumetz attempting to murder him in
New York) which the romanticists add on their own
authority, it is Talleyrand himself who tells it, in the
memoirs. I am not quite sure that this puts it
beyond dispute, but probably we should admit it, and
see in it a proof of the most unusually restless and
irritated temper he had fallen into in America. However,
his petition had succeeded at Paris. Mme. de Staël,
who was sincerely devoted to him, induced Legendre
and Boissy d’Anglas to favour the petition. It was
presented to the Convention on September 4th, and
supported by M. J. Chénier and the ex-Oratorian,
Daunou. Talleyrand’s name was erased from the list of
<i>émigrés</i>, and he was described as an unappreciated
patriot. He had struck the right note in alluding to
“the tyranny of Robespierre.” The various sections
of the Terrorists had annihilated each other in mutual
distrust; and more peaceful, if not quite more admirable,
elements had come to power. In the summer of 1795
the Jacobin Club was closed, and the once terrible
name was now laughingly hurled at one as “Jacoquin.”
Sanculottist Paris had risen in insurrection twice, and
had twice been chased back into its slums. Chénier had
only to describe Talleyrand as a victim of the persecutions
of Marat and Robespierre, and “the perfidy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
Pitt,” and one whose “noble conduct as a priest and
man had greatly promoted the Revolution,” and his
name was struck off the black list. He let Beaumetz
sail alone for India, bade farewell to Hamilton and
la for Rochefoucauld and his many friends in the States,
and sailed for Europe in a Danish vessel in November.
He had not been thirty (as he says), but twenty, months
in America. It had seemed longer.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">THE REGENERATED PARIS</span></p>


<p>The ship in which Talleyrand had sailed from America
was bound for Hamburg, which it reached in January,
1796. The prudent diplomatist wanted to take a
nearer look at the regenerated capital of his country
before re-entering it. His discretion was timely. In
October the mob had risen for a third time against
the new authority, and Citizen Buonaparte had swept
it back definitively into powerlessness in the space of
two hours. But the new rulers had a strong family
resemblance to the old. The five Directors had to be
regicides; Sieyès, who had voted for “death without
any fuss” on poor Louis, had made this new constitution.
In the two new Chambers, the Council of the
Five Hundred and the Council of Ancients, a two-thirds
majority was to be taken over from the dissolving
Convention. One-third had to be elected by the
country, now returning to sobriety; but until the old
majority should be broken by the retirement and
re-election of a fresh third in May the situation was
not reassuring. There remained a good deal of bitterness
against emigrant aristocrats and their friends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
Mme. de Staël was herself attacked with some virulence,
and had to leave the country. Talleyrand decided to
remain for the present at Hamburg.</p>

<p>There was a lively and interesting company at that
time at Hamburg, and Talleyrand met many old friends.
He tells us in the memoirs, with that tinge of malice
that at times borders on ill-nature, that Madame de
Flahaut, who was there, sent out a note to the ship
before he landed, asking him to return to America.
Her husband, Count Flahaut, had been guillotined
during the Revolution, and his widow had met at
Hamburg, and was about to marry, the Portuguese
Minister, the Marquis de Souza. She felt that the
presence of Talleyrand might lead to embarrassment.
But Talleyrand was not heroic enough to face the ocean
and America again in her matrimonial service. Another
interesting friend he found at Hamburg was Mme. de
Genlis. He found so little change in her that, unconscious
of its application to others, he is tempted to pen
an aphorism: “The fixity of compound natures is due
to their suppleness.” His former Secretary of Embassy
at London, and later friend and colleague, Reinhard,
was there, and they increased their attachment during
those months of waiting. His former chief, General
Dumouriez, had fled there. Besides the French emigrants
of all parties, there was also a group of Irish
rebels, led by Lord Edward Fitzgerald. Apart from
the anxiety and inactivity, the time would pass
pleasantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span></p>

<p>In May the elections for the Chambers strengthened
the moderate element at Paris, and it became once
more habitable. But Talleyrand took his time in
returning. From Hamburg he went in the summer
to Amsterdam, and in a fortnight passed on to Brussels,
where he remained for a month or two. The story of
his going to Berlin for three months on a secret mission
seems to be apocryphal. In September he re-entered
Paris.</p>

<p>We are left to imagine the feelings with which he
contemplated the regenerated capital of the Republic.
He had last lived there in 1792, when equality and
fraternity were expressing themselves with such ungraceful
logic. The Revolution was now spent. Equality
and fraternity were forgotten; liberty was construed
in a sense that made even the liberal shudder. The
Paris that had issued from the womb of the Revolution,
with such fangs as of a giant offspring, was a grotesque
abortion. The poor were as poor as ever, as despised
as ever, as much preyed on by parasites as ever. But
the new class that filled the theatres and the larger
houses was insufferable. An epidemic of speculation had
set in. Brokers and bankers met you at every corner,
and shrill females assailed you in the streets with
bundles of notes. The paper-money of the successive
authorities and the confiscation of ecclesiastical and
emigrant property had led to these spectacles. Some
won the prizes, and, if they succeeded in carrying their
money beyond the “camp of Tartars” at the Palais<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
Egalité, bought emigrant hotels and entered “Society”&mdash;a
society such as the world has rarely seen. The
frequent mention of freedom during the last few years
had led to a study of the life of the “free peoples of
antiquity,” which rested on slavery. Sonorous Greek
and Latin names decorated the new generation. Greek
and Roman garments hung about their slim Parisian
persons. The men got the idea that the <i>hetairæ</i> were
the chief feature of classic life: and the women thought
it was the use of transparent dress&mdash;though it is gratifying
to learn that some of them were hooted when they
attempted to walk the Bois in this costume. Wealthy
brokers built Roman homes, not forgetting the fish
ponds, for their <i>amies</i>. The journals announced as
many divorces as marriages. What with war and
guillotine and pike the multiplication of patriots had
become urgently necessary, and the only qualification
for fraternity was patriotism; they had long before
anticipated Mr. G. Bernard Shaw, and proposed to
supply such as the Abbé Fauchet with a harem of twenty
healthy <i>citoyennes</i>. Actresses and adventuresses and
ex-nuns were fought for by men who had made fortunes
on flour or paper-money, or emigrant property, and
clothed with the wardrobes of dead princesses, and
reopened the salons of the old regime; the furniture,
decorations, and social forms not a little confused. At
table they ate and drank much, and talked little. Balls,
especially fancy dress balls, were held daily, transparent
trousers and the light costume of heathen goddesses not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
being prohibited in an age of liberty. Churches and
convents had been turned into restaurants and dancing-rooms
for the most part.</p>

<p>When Chateaubriand returned to Paris a few years
later (and it had improved a little), he said that he felt
as if he was going into the mouth of hell. On different
grounds Talleyrand may have said much the same. His
moral ideal was taste. License without refinement he
felt to be immoral. He had, too, a deep sense of
humour and of humanity. The one was inflamed at
every turn; the other was afflicted at the spectacle
of this pitiful issue of all the sacrifices of the
last six years. As usual, he looked about for stray
consolations, and awaited developments. At the “Constitutional
Club” he met whatever liberal, decent men
there were left in Paris. He was, indeed, welcomed
by the new queens of the salons, as Lytton assures us.
In the revenge of time a “grand seigneur” of the old
regime had come to be regarded as a superior being
once more. A few with titles and empty purses in
their pockets, were still living at, or had returned to
Paris; they made excellent <i>maitres d’hotel</i>. Talleyrand,
with his high reputation for wit, culture and laxity,
was regarded as a <i>ci-devant</i> worth cultivating. Only
occasionally, if reports may be trusted, did he express
himself. One story goes that a lady of the transparent
trousers order once invited him to her house, and
donned her classic garments for the occasion. On the
following day, when she had a numerous company, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
box arrived from Talleyrand, containing “a costume for
Madame.” She opened it before her jealous friends
with great eagerness. It contained a fig-leaf. On the
other hand Talleyrand was made a member of the
Institut, the founding of which he had advocated in
1791. He read two papers there with his usual success.
The first dealt with the commercial relations of England
with the United States; the second pointed out the
advantages to be derived from the new colonies.
Talleyrand believed in the virtue of colonial work for
the regeneration of an enfeebled or overcrowded nation.
He was, he says, preparing a third paper on the
influence of society in France, but was dissuaded from
giving it. He would hardly venture to touch such a
subject at that time, but it is a pity he has not left us
the paper.</p>

<p>With that disregard for mere truthfulness in small
matters which we notice throughout the memoirs (when
there is a motive), he tells us that he kept aloof from
politics, and only yielded after some refusals to the
solicitations of Mme. de Staël. We know perfectly well
that he was at the end of his purse, and was, if for no
other reason, compelled to seek public service. He
wrote to Mme. de Staël that he had only the means of
subsistence for another month, and he would “blow his
brains out if she did not find him a place.” He had
then been in Paris more than six months, and saw no
opening. Michaud says that he had left what little
money remained to him (50,000 francs) in a bank at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
Hamburg. Castellane tells a curious story of his having
left his silver in charge of a number of market-women
when he left France, and says that he collected every bit
of it when he returned in 1796. But he had now an
establishment to keep up. The diplomatist had been
smitten at last by an unexpected type of woman. When
Madame Grand first met him, or first lived with him, it
is quite impossible to determine. The more plausible
authorities are contradictory, and the lady’s career has
been as thickly encrusted with romance as that of Talleyrand.
Her nationality is doubtful. Her father is
generally believed to have been an Englishman, though
some speak of him as a Dutch sailor, and others as a
Breton. She was born in India, and her mother is said
to have been a native. She was married, when young,
to a Swiss, M. Grand, but he had divorced her when she
had captivated no less a person than Sir Philip Francis.
When Sir Philip returned to England, she came to Paris,
and for some years we trace her indistinctly flitting
between Paris, London and Hamburg. It may have
been at Hamburg, but her German biographer thinks it
was more probably at Paris, in 1797, that she met and
captured Talleyrand.</p>

<p>Three points about her are clearly established. She
was very beautiful&mdash;“the beauty of two centuries,” one
enthusiast says&mdash;not at all cultured, and very far from
puritanical. Her lithe, graceful figure, pure white forehead,
wide-opened, tender blue eyes, with long, dark
lashes, and especially her long, soft, golden-brown hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
&mdash;“the most wonderful hair in Europe”&mdash;are described
by contemporaries with some warmth. The obvious
strain of Indian blood in her complexion and bearing
increased the charm, and her intellectual deficiency was
not accentuated by any attempt to conceal it. She seems
to have been devoted to her distinguished protector, and
although she later admitted a Spanish prince to a share
in her affection, she always spoke of him with great
admiration. Talleyrand must have loved her in return.
It is true that he only married her under compulsion
from Napoleon, but most of his biographers quite
wrongly suppose that he was, from the ecclesiastical
point of view, <i>ever</i> free to marry. They lived together,
affectionately and faithfully, as far as one can tell, until&mdash;twelve
years later&mdash;the Princess Talleyrand was
infatuated by the Prince of Spain. Talleyrand explains
his choice of a woman without culture on the ground
that “a woman of intelligence often compromises her
husband; without it, she can only compromise herself.”
The truth seems to be that there was no calculation
whatever in the match. The plain phrase, he fell in love
with her, accurately describes what happened. A man
of exceptional mental power often finds the ablest of his
female contemporaries, with their strain and effort to
reach his level, impossible companions; moreover,
Talleyrand was a deeply amorous and uxorious man.
When friends had pointed out to him that his actress-friend
at Saint Sulpice was without mental gifts, he said
he had not noticed it. Mme. de Flahaut&mdash;for whom,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>however, one can only admit a qualified attachment&mdash;had
kept almost the only non-political house in Paris
before the Revolution.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="small"><i>From an engraving, after a picture by F. Gérard.</i></p>

<p class="caption">MADAME TALLEYRAND.</p></div>


<p>It was now more needful than ever to secure an
appointment.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> Mme. de Staël lent Talleyrand 24,000
francs, and promised to use her influence on the
Directorate. Lytton connects Talleyrand’s appointment
with the reading of his papers at the Institut. Two of
the Directors, Rewbell and Reveillère belonged to it,
and possibly heard his second paper on July 13th.
These were the most decent members of the group of
five which then ruled France, and it is natural that they
should appreciate Talleyrand’s worth to the country.
But Mme. de Staël won over the most important of the
five, Barras, and induced him to invite Talleyrand to
dine at his house at Suresnes. The other four lived
with their families in a modest and respectable fashion
under the eyes of the people at the Luxembourg.
Barras, an aristocrat by birth, but coarse, violent, and
sensual, made a good deal of money by secret
commissions, and kept a lively establishment at
Suresnes, besides the apartments at the Luxembourg
where Mme. Tallien presided. An accident afforded a
good opportunity to Talleyrand. Whilst he waited at
Barras’ house the latter’s aide-de-camp, a youth to whom
he was greatly attached, was drowned in the river, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>it fell to Talleyrand to console the very distressed
Director. He made a useful impression on Barras; in
fact that functionary some time later paid him the
awkward compliment of saying that his ways “would
sweeten a dung-hill.” There was a change in the
Ministry soon afterwards, and Barras warmly presented
Talleyrand for foreign affairs. Rewbell and Reveillère
supported him. Carnot opposed everything that Barras
proposed, and Barthélemy followed Carnot. But the
three carried the nomination. That night at ten o’clock
Talleyrand was called out of the Salon des Étrangers by
a gens-d’arme. He brought an official notification
signed by Carnot. Talleyrand foolishly wastes a
paragraph or two in explaining several reasons why he
felt bound to accept. One would like him better it
he had devoted them to a grateful acknowledgment of
the help given him by Mme. de Staël. But she
seems to have bored him a good deal, and in any case
they had separated before these pages were written.
“She has only one defect,” he once said: “She is
insufferable.”</p>

<p>Thus did Talleyrand enter upon the second stage
of his diplomatic career. From his professional point
of view the situation was superb. France was still at
war with the world, but the success of Napoleon was
gradually bringing matters to the point where diplomacy
begins. There was the prospect of a long series of
treaties. Talleyrand was, as ever, ardently desirous of
peace; he wrote to Madame de Staël with that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
assurance.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> Unfortunately, his chiefs were very meddlesome,
very quarrelsome, and not very competent.
They “had been chosen in anger, and had not transcendent
ability,” says Mme. de Staël. Barras, a violent
ex-soldier, with a good judgment and some penetration,
was a Dantonist, and of loose and luxurious life.
Carnot, the second strong man, detested Barras on both
counts. He was a Robespierrean, a man of strict
conduct, shrewd but narrow. Rewbell, a moderate, a
lawyer of ability and integrity, but rather gruff, detested
both Carnot and Barras and their traditions. Reveillère,
honest and peaceful, tried to mediate. Barthélemy,
ex-abbé, supported Carnot. Their deliberations
were lively. At the first meeting of the Directorate
that Talleyrand attended Carnot, raising his hand,
swore that some accusation of Barras’ was untrue.
“Don’t raise your hand,” shouted Barras; “it would
drip with blood.” “These are the men,” says Talleyrand,
“with whom I was to work to reintroduce
France into European society.” He would not even
see the good points of his colleagues of the Institut.
Reveillère was a supporter of the new “Theophilanthropists”&mdash;“a
gang of thieves,” says Talleyrand,
with bitter levity. The Theophilanthropists correspond
to what are now called “Ethical Societies.” They hired
halls, in which they had moral discourses and lectures
on philosophy, with singing of undogmatic hymns.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>
<p>With the very few churches left active in Paris, they
formed the only sobering influence. But Talleyrand
had, by the time he wrote his memoirs, lost all admiration
of the philosophic morality he had so much appreciated
in his speech on education.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Directors left their Ministers no
initiative. Talleyrand says he had little to do except
sign documents drawn up by them and give passports.
On one occasion Rewbell compelled him to re-write the
instructions he was sending to envoys. The romantic
biographers describe another occasion when, they say,
Barras threw an ink-pot at him. Representatives abroad
complained that France had no policy. The Directors
were too slavishly influenced by their emissaries, and
each of them had his own plan. There was, too, the
eternal scarcity of money. At the Department the
salaries of most of the officials were in arrears. At his
official residence he would have us believe that the
servants were dining off Sèvres dishes because they
could not afford to buy earthenware.</p>

<p>The difficulty increased rapidly. There was still
great distress in the country, and plots against the
Directory were continual; one writer says there was an
average of one per day. Six weeks after Talleyrand’s
nomination a crisis occurred, and his conduct during it
has been severely censured. The relaxation of the
more violent measures had encouraged the royalists and
other malcontents to act more vigorously. Evidence
reached the Directors (partly from Napoleon) of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
powerful and far-reaching conspiracy against them. At
the head of it was the royalist General Pichegru, who
was believed to have a following of 180 deputies. The
Clichy Club at Paris had become a notorious rallying-place
for malcontents, and Director Carnot was patronising
it in a very compromising way. On the other hand,
the Constitutional Club&mdash;with Talleyrand and Constant
and Mme. de Staël&mdash;could naturally be relied on to
oppose a counter-revolution, little as it respected the
Directorate. Napoleon, too, made it clear that his assistance
could be had.</p>

<p>It is, however, in complete opposition to the
evidence, that Lytton accuses Talleyrand of taking the
initiative; and still worse is Michaud’s reckless statement
that Talleyrand “arranged everything.” A sober
inquiry into the <i>coup d’état</i> of Fructidor only discovers
that Talleyrand supported it in advance, but was not
implicated in the violent manner of its execution, which,
indeed, he used his influence to moderate. On the
information supplied to the Directors no legal action
could be taken. Reveillère, whose life was threatened,
then conceived the idea of acting by force, though
without unnecessary severity. He approached Rewbell,
who consented, and the two easily induced Barras to
join. It is absurd to suppose that these officials, who
hampered Talleyrand in his own department and kept
him in habitual ignorance of other affairs, should do
more than secure his support as a Constitutionalist.
Napoleon was requested to send troops, and to these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
he added as general the excitable and meddlesome
Augereau, who soon had his men quartered within
striking distance. The Clichy Clubbites meantime grew
more audacious, and on September 3rd they warmly
cheered a proposal in the Chamber to destroy the
executive. That night the streets of Paris rang with
the unfamiliar tread of an army, a token to all that
an unconstitutional act was afoot. The next morning
the two Councils found themselves surrounded by
10,000 troops. Pichegru and 42 of his followers in
the Five Hundred, Barbé-Mabois and eleven of the
Ancients, and 148 other alleged conspirators, especially
journalists, were arrested. The Directors had warned
Carnot and Barthélemy, whom they had no wish to
injure personally. Carnot, who had long toyed with
the Opposition, and had resisted every friendly overture,
now fled. Barthélemy was arrested. Merlin de Douai,
a lawyer, and Francois de Neufchateau, a literary man,
took the places of Carnot and Barthélemy. The new
Directorate obtained extensive powers from the newly-constituted
Councils, revived the old stringent decrees
against emigrants and priests, and initiated a long series
of deportations. They sent 65 of the worst conspirators
to Guiana&mdash;the guillotine would have been more
merciful&mdash;and the rest to the Isle of Oléron. In all
some 10,000 Nonconformist priests and returned
royalists were prescribed, but only a proportion of these
were actually banished. There was another general
flight to the frontier.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p class="caption">CARNOT.</p></div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<p>As I said, it is absurd to ascribe to Talleyrand a
very active share in these proceedings. The charge
seems to rest chiefly on the authority of Miot de Melito
and Pasquier; both are deeply prejudiced against
Talleyrand (Miot de Melito had just been deposed from
his embassy at Turin by the Foreign Minister), and both
were hundreds of miles away from Paris at the time.
It is a good instance of the levity with which the case
against Talleyrand is conducted. Talleyrand was at
Barras’ house the night before the <i>coup d’état</i>; so were
Constant and Mme. de Staël, who, Pasquier admits,
“wished the day but not the morrow.” It is admitted,
moreover, that Talleyrand used every effort to moderate
the execution of the laws, and saved several individuals
from banishment. As to the defence of the proceedings
in his letter to Napoleon and his circular letter to the
government agents abroad, no one will be so foolish as
to seek in these an expression of his judgment. Officially
he had to present the case in optimistic language or
resign. The only ground for a censure is, in fact, that
he did not resign; and it would be to ascribe to
Talleyrand a quite heroic degree of sensitiveness to expect
him to resign on account of a procedure which Thiers
soberly regards as having “prevented civil war, and
substituted in its stead a stroke of policy executed with
energy, but with all the calmness and moderation possible
in times of revolution.”</p>

<p>Probably one of the clearest proofs that the Directors
were not much indebted to Talleyrand for their successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
extinction of the conspiracy lies in the fact that his
relations with them became more strained than ever. In
October the Prussian envoy wrote to his Government
that Talleyrand could only retain his position “by a
miracle of intelligence and conduct.” Four of the
Directors would not speak to him, and he was reduced
almost to the position of a clerk in his department. It
suits Michaud to imagine that Talleyrand took the
initiative in important matters like the revolutionising of
Switzerland, where there was money to be had. It is
certain, however, that Talleyrand had no responsible part
in forming the Roman and Helvetian Republics. In his
<i>Éclaircissements</i> (July, 1799) he says he was not even
present at a single discussion on the matter. On the other
hand, he must have felt some satisfaction when he saw
how Napoleon was ignoring the Directors. In October
Napoleon concluded the treaty of Campo Formio with
Austria, in complete opposition to the instructions
Talleyrand had been sending him to the end of
September. Talleyrand wrote him a letter of warm
congratulation, which I give later. He secured the
nomination of Napoleon as plenipotentiary at the subsequent
Congress of Rastadt, but the instructions sent to
him were always drawn up by the Directors. Talleyrand
had been similarly slighted in the negotiations for
peace with England. He had come into office at the
time when Lord Malmesbury was conferring with the
French envoys at Lille. Malmesbury was sincerely
anxious to effect peace, though Talleyrand believes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
Pitt had merely sent him as a blind. Talleyrand
wrote a memorandum on the situation soon after
his appointment, in which he pleaded for a real effort
to secure peace, and suggested a tactical procedure
in view of the embarrassed position of the English
Government. He was called “an ass” for his pains,
and was directed to replace Maret by two new envoys
with inflated statements of the position and claim
of France. On September 18th Malmesbury sadly
recognised that peace was impossible, and returned to
London. The truth was that the Directors now relied
on the operations of Napoleon to fill their empty coffers
and sustain their prestige.</p>

<p>In October of the same year (1797) occurred an
event which Talleyrand’s critics contemplate in a perfect
luxury of moral indignation. Vice, venality, and
treachery are said to be the capital offences of his career.
The first charge we have considered; the third can be
appreciated only at a later stage; the second now calls
for examination. Let me indicate at once my reply to
it. Talleyrand was not “venal” in the more offensive
sense of the word. He never sold the interest of his
country, or any humane cause. He <i>did</i> endeavour to
make as much money as possible out of the Governments
and princes which benefitted, or escaped injury,
by his diplomatic arrangements; but these were always
in the interest of France. Further, whatever be said
of diplomatic arrangements in our time, the secret
transfer of money was a common association of them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
Talleyrand’s day; and the transaction, being secret, was
commonly exaggerated. At the signing of the Treaty
of Paris in 1815, Metternich and Nesselrode were
accused of taking a million each from Louis XVIII.
M. de Bacourt, who was in a position to know, says
they “only took the <i>usual</i> diplomatic present” (boxes
worth 18,000 francs each). Hangwitz is accused
of being still more venal. Mirabeau and Danton
had been in the secret pay of the Court. Mirabeau
is even said to have taken a thousand <i>louis d’or</i>
from Spain for his diplomatic recommendation in
1790. Sieyès took 400,000 francs from Napoleon
for his share in making him First Consul&mdash;when,
in fact, Napoleon distributed a respectable fortune.
Barras was notoriously corrupt. Rewbell was implicated.
Roger Ducos was bought. Pitt had been quite
willing to make the Directors a secret present of
ten and a half million francs (while loftily refusing to
pay two million sterling) during the negotiations, and
Malmesbury had on his own account tried to buy
the vote of one of the Directors. Fifty blacks do
not make one white. I am only pointing out that
Talleyrand’s conduct was not distinctive. He had far
more opportunities than any other man of his time;
and the actual charges against him are generally
frivolous. The American “scandal” is one of the most
authentic.</p>

<p>Adams had sent envoys to Paris in 1797 to settle
the differences outstanding between the United States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
and France. Instead of being invited at once to meet
Talleyrand, they were visited by secret agents who
hinted that they came from the Foreign Minister, and
said the Directors were too angry to negotiate, but
might be induced to do so. The means they indicated
were, firstly, a private payment of 1,200,000 livres
(£50,000) “to the Directors,” and secondly, a loan
from America to France<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> of 32,000,000 on Dutch
securities that were only worth half that sum. After a
number of interviews the envoys were recalled by their
President, and a full account of the negotiations
(without the names of the agents) was published by the
United States. Talleyrand disowned his agents, but
there can be no reasonable doubt that they acted on his
instructions. His action provoked a widespread and
deserved censure, but certain features of the transaction
need to be emphasised. Talleyrand was certainly acting
for Barras, though he would assuredly share the spoil.
Further, the American envoys never professed the least
moral resentment of the suggestion of a commission
until all was over. During the negotiations they wrote
home of it as being “according to diplomatic usage,” and
said they “might not so much regard a little money,
such as he stated to be useful.” No stress whatever is
laid on it, “that being completely understood on all sides
to be required for the officers of Government, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>therefore needing no further explanation.” Their
objection was solely raised against the loan, which they
regarded as a kind of tribute wrung from the States. It
was also this second proposal that led to the dangerous
outbreak of anger and war-like preparations in the
States, as the Cambridge text-book shows. It is quite
clear that the suggestion of a commission alone would
have done no harm, and would not have been considered
unusual, except in amount, which was possibly determined
by Barras.</p>

<p>Thus an examination of the documents published
by the American Government greatly reduces the gravity
of the matter. Had there been no suggestion of a loan
we should never have heard of it; and even in France
the cry of “scandal” was very much confused with a
perception of the very evil result of pressing the loan,
which was an honest, if impolitic, attempt to trade in
the interest of the nation. Sieyès wrote from Berlin to
reproach Talleyrand with “trafficking in his honour.”
There are so many who make amends to the moral
ideal by their generosity in condemning others. Mme.
de Staël implored Talleyrand to exculpate himself, but
he smiled. His habitual critics were, of course, delighted
at so well authenticated an exposure, and to the
Michauds and Sainte-Beuves of a later date this one
exact documentary proof has seemed providential. So
little serious notice was taken of it (apart from the
loan) by sober men at the time that, when Talleyrand
resigns on other grounds, in the following year, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
writes the only apologia of his life, he dismisses this
in two lines.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>This American affair, of which we have such
accurate information, affords a firm footing in the
controversy about Talleyrand’s “venality.” The rest is
mainly hear-say and wild conjecture, resting largely on
the authority of discarded subordinates (like Miot de
Melito), political opponents (like Pasquier), foreign
rivals (like Roux, or Palmerston), or other people
with grievances (like Napoleon in his later years). It
is not usual to take such evidence at its face value.
Sainte-Beuve makes a most bitter attack on Talleyrand
under this head, but has little to say in detail beyond
a vague statement that Talleyrand at some time or other
calculated he had made sixty millions by commissions.
Sainte-Beuve’s reputation for scholarship and discrimination
happily does not rest on his “Talleyrand.”
Bastide makes a more honest attempt to support his own
statement that Talleyrand gained thirty millions during
three years. He can, however, only swell his list of
gains in detail to 14,650,000 livres, and many of the
larger items are quite out of place, or wholly ridiculous.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span></p>

<p>He solemnly tells us he thinks it is a sufficient guarantee
for the accuracy of his items that they are found in
publications of the time, and were not contradicted by
Talleyrand! The biographer who takes literally every
charge he finds in the pamphlets of 1789-1799, or
expects to find them seriously met by men like Talleyrand,
has a curious idea of his work. And the historians
of our day who rely on such biographers deserve little
sympathy. Michaud is more reckless than Bastide.
Lady Blennerhassett has taken up his specific allegation
that Talleyrand defrauded Spain of 24,000,000 livres
(by concealing the reduction of its subsidy and pocketing
the difference), and shown it to be impossible. The
treaty with Portugal is said by some writers to have
yielded Talleyrand 3,000,000; Bastide puts his profit
at 1,200,000; and Michaud merely “feels sure”
Talleyrand made <i>something</i> out of it. Roux declares he
made 5,000,000 out of the treaty with Switzerland, and
Napoleon was very liberal in his later estimates of
Talleyrand’s greed.</p>

<p>Quite certainly Talleyrand’s commissions have been
grossly exaggerated. The flimsiest charges and the
wildest conjectures have been eagerly used against him.
But he did probably make a large sum in this way
whilst he was Foreign Minister. He let it be known
amongst the foreign ambassadors that he expected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>money. Mme. Grand occasionally facilitated an understanding
in this sense; Napoleon accused her of
operations on her own account at times. Talleyrand
despised his chiefs, and saw a very misty prospect for
the future. He resolved to use his position to make
some provision. However, he never sold the interest
of his country, and he was, as Senfft says, “never
induced to favour plans which he regarded as dangerous
to the peace of Europe.” Senfft tells how, on a later
occasion, the Poles put 4,000,000 florins in the hands
of his agent, but Talleyrand returned them when he
found it impossible to do what they desired. I am not
trying to show that his conduct was consistent with a
strong and high character, but rebutting the exaggerated
charges which lead sober historians to say, as Sloane
does, that “there was never greed more dishonest than
his.”</p>

<p>This is almost the sole aspect of Talleyrand’s
diplomatic work under the Directory that we need
consider. His splendid gifts were never utilised, the
Directors employing him as little more than chief clerk
of the Foreign Office. In July, 1798, he presented to
them a long and very able memorandum on the situation
abroad, and about that time there was some talk of his
entrance into the Directorate. The Prussian ambassador
wrote home that such an event would almost put an
end to the convulsions of Europe. But the Directors
were fixed in their fine contempt for his views, and they
made diplomacy impossible. Talleyrand suffered himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
to remain the organ of their absurd conceptions until
the middle of 1799. A man of his temper could
tolerate the position at such a price. Meantime he
lived pleasantly at the Hotel Galiffet. The authoress
of the <i>Mémoires d’une Contemporaine</i> describes how he
spent hours in idle talk with her at the office, and
curled her hair with thousand-franc notes. But one eye
was fixed all the time on a strenuous figure that was
leading the armies in the south&mdash;the figure of Napoleon
Buonaparte. In that direction lay the only hope for
the restoration of France and of diplomacy.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">ENTER NAPOLEON</span></p>


<p>Talleyrand had written at once in 1797 to inform the
commander of the army of Italy of his nomination to
the Foreign Ministry. “Justly apprehensive,” he said,
“of functions of which I feel the fateful importance, I
need to reassure myself by the consciousness of how
much the negotiations will be facilitated by your glory.
The very name of Buonaparte is an auxiliary that will
remove all difficulties.” He had already a dim prevision
of the day when the princes of Europe would gather
timidly about the dreaded figure of the Corsican and his
Foreign Minister. He says that Napoleon had written
to him first. This is probably untrue; but Napoleon at
once replied, and the two men immediately appreciated
each other. Within a few weeks Napoleon sent him a
long and curious letter containing his views on constitutional
questions and popular representation. About the
same time he spoke to Miot de Melito about Talleyrand
in terms of high appreciation. When Napoleon closed
the Austrian campaign and signed the Treaty of Campo
Formio, in opposition to the instructions from Paris,
Talleyrand wrote him a private letter of extravagant
congratulation. “So we have peace made&mdash;and peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
à la Buonaparte. Accept my hearty compliments,
General. Words could not convey all I feel just now.
The Directors are satisfied, the public delighted. All is
for the best. There may be some muttering from Italy,
but it does not matter. Good-bye, peace-making
General. Friendship, admiration, respect, gratitude&mdash;one
does not know where to end.” The feeling was
sincere, and Talleyrand had a way of conveying high
compliments without incongruity. These early letters,
Sainte-Beuve says, remind one of Voltaire’s honeymoon
with Frederic.</p>

<p>In December Napoleon arrived at Paris, and the
two men met for the first time. Each, of course, now
says that the other sought the interview. Napoleon had
changed his route as he approached Paris, and was at his
house in the Rue Chantereine before his arrival was
known. He says that Talleyrand called at once; but as
even Josephine found his door barred and Napoleon
mad with angry suspicion of her, he could not be seen
that night. On the following morning Talleyrand and
Mme. de Staël and a few friends waited in the Hotel
Galiffet, when Napoleon, quietly dressed, pale, very
silent, entered the salon. He took Talleyrand into his
private room, and had a long conversation with him, and
then Talleyrand introduced him to the Directors at the
Luxembourg. Napoleon puzzled in a charming way the
citizens of Paris. He dressed with ostentatious plainness,
spoke little, and avoided public meetings and demonstrations.
At the Luxembourg a splendid reception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
ceremony had been prepared. The Directors sat on a
dais in the court in their stagey satin clothes, lawyers
and parliamentarians filled the amphitheatre, and a great
orchestra and choir rendered an ode written for the
occasion. Talleyrand said in his introductory speech:
“When I observe all that he does to cover his glory,
this classic taste for simplicity that distinguishes him,
his love of abstract science, his favourite books, that
sublime <i>Ossian</i> which seems to detach him from earth;
when I see his disdain for show, for luxury, for pomp,
those petty ambitions of common souls&mdash;then, far from
dreading what some would call his ambition, I feel that
some day you may have to drag him forth from his
studious retreat.” Napoleon probably thanked him for
keeping up the show, but may have feared he was
overdoing it. They understood each other, yet really
liked each other.</p>

<p>Talleyrand gave a magnificent festival in honour of
the conqueror; though he confesses some difficulty in
finding ladies amongst the women of Paris! As it was,
the wife of one of the Directors openly observed to him:
“What a lot it must have cost you, citizen-minister!”
He also induced Napoleon, though with great difficulty,
to attend the anniversary of the King’s execution.
Napoleon did not wait long to abolish that suggestive
commemoration. But the jealousy and uneasiness of
the Directors made Napoleon’s position uncomfortable.
He began immediately to look for another field for
military action. The Directors thought of Ireland as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
sufficiently remote locality, but Napoleon was better
informed as to the possibility of a direct attack on
England. He then unfolded to Talleyrand the plan
for an invasion of Egypt, and it was laid before the
Directors. The idea had occurred to one or two earlier
dreamers in France, but, in spite of what Napoleon
afterwards said, it is incredible that Talleyrand should
have really approved it. It was certainly Talleyrand’s
idea that France should extend along the whole shore
of the Mediterranean, and leave the high seas to
England, but a leap from Marseilles to Alexandria was
a different matter. However, he lent Napoleon the
collection of Egyptian documents in the Foreign Office,
and clearly did not oppose his plan. Miot de Melito,
who was in close communication with Napoleon, and
who would not lose an opportunity of blaming Talleyrand,
says that Napoleon acted entirely on his own
view and dragged everybody with him. Within twelve
months we find Talleyrand (in his <i>Éclaircissements</i>)
openly denying that he had approved the expedition.</p>

<p>However, the Directors yielded, and the famous
fleet of 500 vessels sailed from Toulon on May 19th,
1798. Talleyrand had apparently promised to follow
within twenty-four hours, to arrange matters with the
Sultan at Constantinople. He was, however, ill at the
time, and it is doubtful whether he ever intended to do
so. If we may trust the memoirs, he saw only a
personal design in the expedition at the time.
Napoleon had spoken to him of founding a rich colony
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>in Egypt, and going on to attack England in India,
but he had dropped a word about returning by way of
Constantinople. That was “not the way to India,” nor
would he be likely to leave the Sultan’s throne standing,
or set up a Turkish Republic, says Talleyrand. In
other words he professes that he thought Napoleon
wanted to found an empire in the East. All this was
written, we must remember, after Napoleon’s imagination
had fully revealed its possibilities. The most
probable reading of the situation is that Talleyrand felt,
like Napoleon, that “the pear was not ripe yet;” that
Napoleon had better keep out of the way for a year or
two; and that something <i>might</i> come of this imposing
military and scientific expedition.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus_205.jpg" width="400" height="537" alt="" />
<p class="caption">BARRAS.</p></div>



<p>In the twelve months that followed the pear ripened
fast. To the chronic financial malady and political
discontent was now added the news of the civil war
in La Vendée and of the disastrous opening of the war
against the second coalition. This was far more
formidable than the first. Austria was encouraged by
the absence of its conqueror, and the support of both
Russia and Turkey. England was fired by the
announcement of Nelson’s victory at Aboukir and the
apparent isolation of Napoleon. Portugal and Naples
were drawn in. The first battles went badly for the
French, and the Directors and Talleyrand were furiously
assailed. Talleyrand thought it wise to withdraw from
the Directors, and they accepted his resignation on
July 20th, with some show of regret. How far he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
then informed of Napoleon’s position and plans it is
impossible to determine; but it is believed that the
Bonapartes at Paris succeeded in communicating with
Egypt. However, Talleyrand, in September, handed
over his <i>portefeuille</i> to his friend, Reinhard. For the
first and only time in his career (if we except his brief
letter in 1791 to the <i>Moniteur</i>) he answered his critics.
His “Explanations to his fellow citizens” fully destroy
the frivolous charges brought against him as a minister
and republican, especially by his interested predecessor,
Lacroix, and the members of the Société du Manège&mdash;whom
Napoleon describes as “a gang of bloodthirsty
ruffians.” In the end Talleyrand turns on his opponents
with some dignity. “What have I done,” he asks, “that
such suspicions should fall on me? Is there anything in
my whole life to justify such a supposition? Have I
ever persecuted or been vindictive? Can any one
reproach me with a single act of severity in the whole
course of my ministry? Have I ever injured anyone,
even by accident?” It was a just rebuke and just
defence. Few of the hands raised against him were
free from blood. It is also notable that the charge of
corruption is not pressed. He then retired to his
country house at Auteuil, to resume his familiar attitude
of awaiting events.</p>

<p>“Those who did not live in those times,” says
de Broglie, “can have no idea how deep was the
despondency prevailing in France between the 18th
Fructidor (September 4th, 1797) and the 18th Brumaire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
(November 9th, 1799).” The Directory had proved
wholly unfitted to govern France. The only question in
the summer of 1799 was: What shall be the next page
in the constitutional history of the country? In May,
Rewbell had had to retire from the Directorate, and the
victorious Jacobins had replaced him by Sieyès, to whom
all now turned for a lead. Sieyès found his colleagues
in the way, and three of them were at once replaced by
two mediocrities, Gohier and Moulin, and an active
supporter, Roger-Ducos. Barras alone remained of the
whole group, and he was now compromised by dallying
with royalist agents. It was clear to Sieyès that the
reins of Government must be put in the strong hands of
a soldier, and he thought of one general after another.
He was not well disposed to Napoleon, but Talleyrand
made it his task to effect a reconciliation. The Buonaparte
family was also very busy at Paris, preparing a reception
for the General who, they said, had been sent by the
Directors on this hopeless campaign in Egypt. On
the 8th of October the agitation was doubled when a
message was received, telling that Napoleon had landed
at Frejus. He had left his army and his difficulties in
charge of Kléber, had evaded the British vessels, and
landed with a few of his generals on the south coast.
On October 18th he arrived at Paris.</p>

<p>The menace of the second coalition had by this
time been arrested by the victories of Masséna and
the withdrawal of the Russians, but the Directorate
was thoroughly discredited, and its enemies were alert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
and vigorous. All parties now turned towards Napoleon
with intense interest. Royalists hoped he would make
himself the instrument of a restoration. The Jacobins,
who had become strong again, watched such a possibility
with concern. The moderates felt that it would lead
to civil war. Every malcontent in Paris knew that
Napoleon held the key of the situation. The only one
who seemed to be unconscious of his importance was
Napoleon himself. After the inevitable round of fêtes
was over&mdash;and it was remarked how he drank his wine
from a private bottle at the public dinner&mdash;he seemed
to forget that he was a soldier. He spent most of his
time at the Institut, discussing questions of science
and philosophy; and when visitors to Paris sought the
great general, they had pointed out to them a quiet,
pale little man in the dress of a scholar of the Institut.
But his little house in the Rue de Victoire soon became
the political centre of Paris. Talleyrand and Bruix
(the Ex-Minister of Marine) were daily bringing
members of the Councils to visit him. Presently
Talleyrand reconciled him with Sieyès to a practicable
extent&mdash;“you have to fill this priest to the neck with
money to get anything out of him,” Napoleon said
afterwards&mdash;and the definite intrigue began. Napoleon
would accept Sieyès’ new constitution. The five
Directors were to be replaced by three Consuls elected
for ten years&mdash;but if he thinks I am going to be a
“fatted pig” he is mistaken, said Napoleon. The
Councils would be suspended for three months, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
then replaced by a Senate (with life-membership), and
an elective Chamber of Deputies.</p>

<p>The next point was to determine the date and
manner of the Revolution. The generals whom
Napoleon had brought were winning over the officers,
but they felt some anxiety about the soldiers, who were
apprehensive of reactionary change. Talleyrand had
rallied the moderates, such as Regnault de Saint-Jean
d’Angély, Roederer, Constant, Cambacérès, Daunou,
and Sémonville.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> They could count on a majority in
the Ancients, and Lucien Buonaparte was President of
the Five Hundred. Fouché, the accommodating
Minister of Police, carefully abstained from reporting to
the Directors what he saw. Barras had, in fact, completely
compromised himself by openly suggesting a
royalist plot to Napoleon. Roger-Ducos was with
Sieyès. Gohier and Moulin stupidly refused to see
anything until the very last moment. The only difficulty
was with the Five Hundred and the soldiers, and
Napoleon could be trusted to win the latter and so crush
the Council. Still it was a time of great anxiety.
Talleyrand tells how Napoleon and he were discussing
plans in his house in the Rue Taitbout at one o’clock in
the morning, when suddenly they heard a company of
cavalry gallop down the street, and halt opposite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>Tallyrand’s door. They put out the light in some
concern, and crept on to the balcony to observe. It was
the carriage of the manager of one of the gaming houses,
returning home with the profits and an escort of gens
d’armes, and it had met with an accident just before
Talleyrand’s door.</p>

<p>On the morning of November 9th (18th Brumaire)
Paris awoke once more to find a revolution afoot. Great
masses of troops were distributed about the streets, and
a crowd of officers was gathered, by invitation, before
Napoleon’s house&mdash;Napoleon telling them from the
balcony he was going to save the Republic. The
Ancients were to meet at seven o’clock, the Five
Hundred at eleven, and in fact a number of the notices
to patriotic members of the latter Council had prudently
gone astray in the post. Under the plea of some vague
conspiracy being abroad the complaisant Ancients decreed
that the legislative bodies be transferred to Saint Cloud
(which was in form constitutional), that Napoleon be
given command of all the troops at Paris, and that three
Consuls be appointed. Napoleon and his generals (who
were going to “pitch the lawyers in the river,” as some
of them said) at one proceeded to the Chamber and
took the oath. The alarmed patriots of the Five
Hundred now met, but were immediately closured by
Lucien on the ground that they had been constitutionally
removed to Saint Cloud. Meantime Barras was in the
hands of Talleyrand, who very soon extorted his resignation.
Sieyès and Ducos resigned. Gohier and Moulin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>were shut up in the Luxembourg. Fouché suspended
the municipalities&mdash;it being a time of trouble. Napoleon
established himself at the Tuileries. His careful and
elaborate plan had so far succeeded.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus_213.jpg" width="400" height="554" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SIEYÈS.</p></div>



<p>On the morrow the Councils were to appoint the
Consuls at Saint Cloud, and meantime a strong
opposition was forming. Three of the generals were
not in the plot, and one of them, Bernadotte, was an
active member of the Jacobin <i>Société du Manège</i>, which at
once attempted to organise a counter-revolution. The
19th Brumaire opened with not a little anxiety. Sieyès
and Ducos had a coach and six at one of the gates of
Saint-Cloud. Talleyrand and a few other “amateurs”
(as he says) had taken a house at Saint Cloud&mdash;with two
alternatives: a dinner was ordered for the evening, but
a coach waited at the door. Napoleon did in fact make
a terrible muddle when it came to his turn to speak.
In the hall where the Ancients met he made a violent,
disjointed, most imprudent speech, answering questions
with the most clumsy fabrications, until Bourrienne had
to drag him away with the remark: “You don’t know
what you are saying.” The Ancients, however, gave the
required vote. But no sooner did Napoleon enter the
hall of the Five Hundred than the deputies raged about
him in crowds. He nearly fainted and had to be
carried out. But his military instinct at once revived.
Mounting his horse he complained to the troops that
his life had been attempted; and when Lucien came out
with the news that they were outlawing him, and Sieyès<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
had drily answered: “Well, as they are putting you
out of the law, put them out of the room,” he cast off all
hesitation. On the previous day when he had attempted
to explain matters to Sebastiani’s dragoons, who formed
his escort, they curtly replied: “We don’t want any
explanations: black or white, we’re with you.” And
every musket was loaded with ball. Napoleon now turned
to the captain of the grenadiers and told him to “go and
disperse this assembly of busy-bodies.” The drums beat
the charge, the grenadiers swept up the grand staircase at
the double, turned into the orangery on the left with
bayonets levelled, and the patriotic Five Hundred fled by
the other doors, or dropped from the windows into the
garden. Talleyrand and his fellow amateurs went to dinner.</p>

<p>That night Lucien gathered together a score or so
of the more reliable elements of the Council, and passed
the new Constitution. Lucien harangued his little
group on the great theme of liberty and the splendid
example of Rome. They declared the Directorate
extinct, and borrowing again from “the free peoples of
antiquity,” appointed a provisional Consulate, consisting
of Napoleon Bonaparte (the Italian “u” had disappeared
by this time), Sieyès, and the faithful Roger-Ducos. They
also proscribed 57 obnoxious deputies, and voted the
thanks of the country to Napoleon for his action. So ended
the French Revolution. An act of despotism, rendered
possible by widespread intrigue and corruption, rang
down the curtain on the ten-year drama of blind, bloody,
Titanic struggles. Yet it was the best thing for France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span></p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">WAR AND DIPLOMACY</span></p>


<p>On the morning of December 11th, 1799, Napoleon
installed himself at the Luxembourg, and began at once
the stupendous activity with which he was to raise
France to the position of first Power in Europe. Within
a fortnight Talleyrand was back at the Foreign Office,
with a prospect at last of using in his correspondence
that “noble language” which the Revolution and
Directorate had disdained to use. Of the civilians in
France, two men alone were necessary to Napoleon&mdash;Fouché
and Talleyrand. Fouché was useful. Talleyrand
had the additional advantage of making Napoleon bow
in secret to his superior culture and finesse. In the
work of the next seven years, which was to raise
France higher than she had ever been in the course of
her history, the soldier and the diplomatist were intimately
joined. For some years it is often impossible,
apart from military operations, to distinguish the action
of the one from that of the other.</p>

<p>In the earlier years of the nineteenth century, in
which the glory of Napoleon and the greatness of France
generally coincide, Talleyrand had an unmistakeable
regard and affection for his chief. No one more fully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
appreciated the genius of Napoleon, in peace or war, and
no one appraised more highly its advantage to France.
He had, too, a sufficient sense of amiable cynicism to
think lightly of the irony with which Napoleon brushed
aside the pretentious forms of liberty and fraternity,
and set up a solid but despotic system of government.
With a smile he saw the country accept with an overwhelming
majority the new scheme of universal suffrage.
The voters of each district were to choose ten of their
number; these tens were to unite in each Department
and choose ten “Notabilities of the Department;”
these were in turn to choose their tens; and then the
governing powers would select the members of the
legislative bodies and the chief officials of the State.
The Council (chosen by the executive) would initiate
measures; the Tribunate, the really popular and able
body, could discuss them (within limits), but not vote on
them; the Legislative Body could vote, but not discuss
them; and the ornate and equally silent Senate
had a right of Veto. Talleyrand gave no support to
Benjamin Constant when he opposed, in the name of
liberty, the almost immediate introduction of the closure
in the Tribunate. Like most of his friends, he at once
deserted Mme. de Staël’s salon, because she impelled
Constant to this course. Nor did he demur when
Bonaparte very quickly reduced the number of journals
from 73 to 13, observing (among other things) that
they were making remarks that insulted “the sovereignty
of the people.” They had been unable to restrain their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
wit over the new democracy. Talleyrand had never
been a “polygarchist,” to use a word which he himself
calls barbarous but inevitable. In his opinion the
people had proved their incompetence to rule. It was
not time-serving, but real conviction, that made him
encourage Napoleon’s monarchical tendency.</p>

<p>So he passed with good spirit through the few
ironic months before Napoleon departed for Italy. He
was present at the first meeting of Sieyès and Napoleon.
Sieyès saw clearly enough the direction of Napoleon’s
policy; Napoleon told him his “Grand Elector” was
a <i>roi fainéant</i>, and “the time of do-nothing kings was
past.” They quarrelled violently and parted. At the
second meeting Sieyès was more amiable. “The pike
is making short work of the other fishes,” said a shrewd
lady to Mme. Bonaparte. By February the constitutional
difficulty was over. Sieyès had disappeared,
with a rich sinecure and a large estate. Ducos was
submerged in the Senate. The “Grand Elector” had
become “First Consul,” with almost unlimited power
over the military, naval, civic and foreign administration.
The amiable Second and Third Consuls, Cambacérès
and Lebrun, were willing to act as little more than background
to Napoleon. The more heated Jacobins were
banished (Talleyrand striking one of his bitterest
enemies, Jarry, off the list of the proscribed). The
more serious members of the old legislation were
distributed over Europe in foreign embassies and consulships.
The Senate was installed at the Luxembourg;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
the virtuous Tribunate at the Palais Egalité (a hotbed
of prostitutes and gamblers); and the Consuls (though
Cambacérès prudently declined the honour) at the
Tuileries. Napoleon issued a proclamation to the
nation, which ended: “Citizens, the Revolution is now
sealed with the principles that first set it afoot. It is
over.” On the last day of the national mourning he
had directed on account of the death of Washington,
Napoleon and his colleagues drove in royal state, in a
splendid carriage drawn by six white horses, to the
Tuileries. They had to pass under a gate over which
still lingered the inscription: “Royalty is abolished
for ever in France.” Talleyrand drove under it with
the other ministers in advance of Napoleon. On the
following day Napoleon went over his new home with
his friends. “Well, Bourrienne,” he said, “here we
are at the Tuileries. The next thing is to see that we
stop here.” But he had it immediately decorated with
the statues or busts of great generals and great democrats
of all nations. Demosthenes, Scipio, Brutus and
Mirabeau smiled or frowned on the visitor amidst a
crowd of warriors and kings.</p>

<p>Talleyrand, who rightly believed that these changes
were for the real good of France, would not be insensible
to the humour of the situation or the diplomatic genius
of the new head of the State. It had been decreed that
ministers should discuss their portfolios every day before
the three Consuls, but Talleyrand had pointed out to
Napoleon on the day of his installation at the Foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
Office (Nov. 21st, 1799) that its affairs were of a peculiarly
private nature, and had proposed that he should
confer with the First Consul alone. Napoleon was more
than willing, and the long, close, and most fruitful
co-operation of the two began. Napoleonist writers are
apt to imagine that Talleyrand was little more than a
clerk, as most of the other ministers were, but we shall
see as we proceed that Napoleon often left even the
initiative to him. Thiers observes that Fouché and
Talleyrand were the only ministers who were not effaced
by the phenomenal activity of Napoleon. His vast
intelligence was already at work on plans for beautifying
Paris, improving the roads of the country, restoring
financial soundness, creating a system of education,
reviving industry, formulating a code of laws, and
effecting a hundred other improvements. A royalist
visitor who saw Napoleon at the time said that he looked
like a well-dressed lackey&mdash;until you met his eye. That
eye was now searching Paris through and through for
means of consolidating his position; it was sweeping
over the broad provinces of France in search of disorders
to remedy and dangers to crush: it was following
royalists and Jacobins into exile, scanning the countenances
of kings and statesmen abroad, counting their ships
and forces, turning from East Indies to West Indies,
from St. Petersburg to Cairo and Persia. In Fouché he
had a political detective, unhampered by the faintest
sense of moral principle, who could answer for Paris.
Gradually relaxing the laws against the emigrants, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
threw open the career to all talent, excepting only the
militant royalists and the most violent Jacobins. Priests
were now only required to promise, not to swear
allegiance; large numbers of emigrants were struck off
the list on one pretext or other, though the peasants
were at the same time assured that not a franc’s worth of
emigrant or ecclesiastical property would be restored;
and all were promptly put under the searchlight of the
Ministry of Police. Even Jacobins were in time
absorbed. Talleyrand saw one leave Napoleon’s room
one day, and expressed surprise at it. “You don’t
know the Jacobins,” said Napoleon. “There are the
salty Jacobins and the sugary Jacobins. That one is a
salty Jacobin. I do what I like with those. They have to
be arrested sometimes, but a little money soon manages
that. But the sugary Jacobins! They would destroy
twenty governments with their metaphysics.”<br /><br /></p>

<p class="caption">NAPOLEON.</p></div>


<p>As long as such a man would leave the choice of
language to Talleyrand the diplomatic combination
would be superb. They got quickly to work. The
year 1799 had hardly closed, London was still wondering
what this new phase of French politics portended,
when George III. received an edifying invitation from
the First Consul to entertain a project of peace. In
flawless and dignified language he was urged to reflect
before plunging Europe once more into the horrors of
war. “The fate of all civilised nations,” the letter
concluded, “cries for the termination of a war that
embraces the whole world.” Pitt replied&mdash;or, rather,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>sent a note to Talleyrand at the Foreign Office&mdash;that
England saw no guarantee of stability in French policy
until the legitimate ruler of the country was restored.
It is generally agreed that this was an egregious blunder,
an arrogant and tactless attempt to dictate to the French
nation. It was, at all events, immediately recognised
as such in France, and the people were more than
reconciled to a continuation of the war with England.
Talleyrand gravely enquired of Lord Grenville what
England would say to a proposal to restore the Stuarts.
Napoleon had written at the same time and in the same
vein to the Emperor of Austria. “A stranger to every
sentiment of vain glory, my first desire is to arrest the
shedding of blood.” Austria replied to Talleyrand, as
England had done, though less offensively, asking for
guarantees of stability. The reply to Austria indicates
clearly enough that, as Talleyrand writes, Napoleon did
not want peace. They were asked to take the Treaty of
Campo Formio (framed when Austria was in a much
worse position) as the base of negotiation.</p>

<p>In both cases the correspondence soon came to a
futile close. Napoleon had reached the steps of the
throne as a military commander, and new victories would
at least sustain his prestige. Moreover, the financial
condition of France was very low, and Napoleon had had
experience of the pecuniary value of victorious warfare.
His letters and the first replies (ignoring his official
position) strengthened his support in the country, and in
fact, as Talleyrand observes, made him out to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
“something of a statesman.” He turned cheerfully to
the rest of his diplomatic task before proceeding to face
Austria. By tactful action in the western provinces he
put an end to the civil war there, induced the Vendean
leaders to come to Paris, and actually attached some of
them to his service. The next important step was to
detach Russia from Austria, secure the neutrality of, if
not an alliance with, Prussia, and have a good understanding
with Spain. The King of Prussia was not
unwilling to see France and Austria exhaust themselves
in a long conflict, while he himself could continue in
peace to strengthen his finances and his army. Duroc
was sent to inform him of the change of Government in
France, and soon afterwards Talleyrand sent his friend
General Beurnonville, an enemy of Austria, to fill the
embassy at Berlin. Through Prussia an attempt was
to be made to reach the Tsar. Very soon Prussia ceased
to talk of the Rhine provinces, and reported that the
opposition to France at St. Petersburg was relaxing.
Napoleon suspected that Prussia was maintaining too
long the profitable rôle of mediator, and urged a direct
appeal to Russia. Hearing that the Tsar had seriously
quarrelled with Austria, and was not well disposed
towards England, he collected all the Russian prisoners
he had, re-clothed them, and sent them home with
military honours. When he further sent the sword of
La Valette to the Tsar (who had been appointed Grand
Master of the Order of St. John, and had an enthusiasm
for his charge) and invited him to take possession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
Malta (then very precariously held by the French
against the English), the Tsar was won.</p>

<p>In the meantime the French Minister at Madrid
had reported on the situation in Spain. A boorish,
thoughtless king, who gave the slightest possible attention
to public affairs: a spirited, hard-working queen,
with an eye for Parisian millinery: a conceited and
incompetent paramour of the queen, Godoy, who was in
reality the first minister of the country. In a few weeks
cases of valuable French arms were on their way to
Godoy. The king, innocent of the vaguest suspicion
of political machinery, desired some for himself. A
splendid assortment was at once dispatched; and
Citoyenne Minette was sent to the queen, with boxes of
exquisite Parisian costumes, chosen by Josephine, and
with diplomatic instructions from Talleyrand in her
pocket.</p>

<p>By the beginning of May Napoleon was ready to
open the campaign against Austria. He had set in
motion his vast plans for the improvement of Paris and
the country, and the restoration of commerce, education,
justice, and order. He had pacified la Vendée, and set
free the troops for the campaign in Italy. Russia was
detached from the coalition, and had sent an ambassador
to Paris&mdash;a man with whom it would be easy to deal,
said Talleyrand, because he had no instructions, and was
incensed against his own government. Prussia was most
benevolently neutral. Spain seemed to have entirely
forgotten Louis XVI. Leaving Talleyrand to sustain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
the good disposition of these Powers, Napoleon set out
on May 6th for Italy. “What we want now,” said
Talleyrand to him, “is for success in war to put new
life into the department of peace.”</p>

<p>Within six weeks came the news of the victory at
Marengo. By July 3rd Napoleon was back in the
capital. Austria was crushed, Italy won, and England
isolated. A new phase of diplomatic work had now to
begin. From the battle-field Napoleon had written to
the Austrian Emperor. The Emperor injudiciously sent
his reply by the same messenger, a very undiplomatic
Austrian soldier, the Count St. Julien, who followed
Napoleon to Paris, and was entrusted to Talleyrand to
deal with. He had, of course, no power whatever to
negotiate, but was instructed to sound the French, and
only say sufficient for that purpose about Austria’s
disposition. Within a week St. Julien signed the
preliminaries of a treaty with France that bound Austria
to close her ports against England (with whom she had
signed an agreement one month before). The inexperienced
soldier had asked Talleyrand’s advice as to the
extent of his powers, and Talleyrand gravely replied that
if he were in St. Julien’s place he would sign. When
Napoleon heard that St. Julien was disavowed and sent
to a fortress, and the negotiations were annulled, he said
that he rather expected it, but merely “wanted to put
the Emperor in the wrong in the eyes of Europe.” He
talked of renewing hostilities, but Talleyrand dissuaded
him, and in October Count Cobentzl reached Paris for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
the serious work of negotiation. In the meantime the
effect of Marengo was visible on all sides. A succession
of fêtes brought Paris and France to the feet of the First
Consul. Millions were sent to the Treasury from the
seat of war.</p>

<p>Cobentzl was to treat with Joseph Bonaparte at
Lunéville, but Napoleon invited him to pay a visit to
Paris first. On the evening of his arrival Talleyrand
took him to the Tuileries. Napoleon had prepared the
very furniture of the room to receive him. Cobentzl,
with distinct recollection of the violent little man who
had smashed his porcelain to illustrate how he would
break Austria, found himself admitted into the large
room on the ground floor where Napoleon worked.
The lustre was unlit. One small lamp shone on the desk
in the far corner where Napoleon sat, and Cobentzl found,
after crossing the long dark room, that all the chairs had
been removed except the one that Napoleon used. He
was nervous and uncomfortable, while Napoleon conducted
his well-rehearsed part with the ease of a
conqueror. The few days in Paris were not pleasant to
the Austrian envoy. He gladly moved to Lunéville to
treat with the less dramatic and less violent Joseph.
Napoleon’s brother had already been used in the
conclusion of a treaty with the United States. It is
absurd to say that Talleyrand was passed over in these
matters for personal reasons. Napoleon’s employment
of his elder brother, who had no mean ability, in these
high affairs of State requires no explanation. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
February 9th, 1801, the new treaty was signed at
Lunéville. Austria was restricted to Venice in Italy,
and lost the Rhine provinces and the Netherlands.
Talleyrand did little more than conduct the correspondence
between the two brothers. Count Cobentzl
had made every effort to escape a rupture with England
by signing a separate peace, but the supervention of the
victory of Hohenlinden in December had too utterly
enfeebled his country.</p>

<p>An event had occurred in December in connection
with which Talleyrand is often severely censured. An
attempt had been made by certain <i>chouans</i> to blow up
the First Consul as he went to the opera. Napoleon
at once called a Council of State, and declared it was
the work of the Jacobins. Whatever the suspicions of
the Councillors were, they knew that Napoleon was
bent on making this a pretext for a severe blow at the
Terrorists, and they said nothing when a number of
the more truculent were executed and deported for a
crime that was afterwards found to be the work of
Royalists. There was much indignation against Fouché
for the negligence of the police. Mr. Holland Rose
says that “if we may credit the <i>on dit</i> of Pasquier,
Talleyrand urged the execution of Fouché.” We may
<i>not</i> credit the <i>on dits</i> of Pasquier when they reflect on
Talleyrand; and such a suggestion is entirely inconsistent
with Talleyrand’s character. It seems to be
stated with more authority (though the reports are not
consistent) that Talleyrand&mdash;probably at the instigation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
of Napoleon&mdash;advocated taking action on a <i>senatus-consultum</i>,
which would dispense with the need of passing
measures through the less complaisant bodies. Talleyrand
said at the time that it was necessary to give
foreign governments one of those guarantees of stability
about which they were so anxious. There were few
tears shed over the brutal and hasty treatment of the
remnant of the Terrorists.</p>

<p>In those early years Talleyrand felt a lively personal
attachment to Napoleon. “The sentiment that attaches
me to you,” he writes, “my conviction that the devotion
of my life to your destiny and to the grand views that
inspire you is not without effect in their realisation, have
made me take more care of my health than I have ever
done before.” Later, when Napoleon had rendered
some service to his family: “I am with you in life or
death.” His letters up to 1804 frequently exhale an
odour that the British perception would class as that of
rank flattery. Making due allowance for the exaggerated
manners of the day, the sentiment seems to be sincere.
The allusions of Napoleonists in later years to “an
Auteuil conspiracy” (where Talleyrand had a house)
early in the nineteenth century are frivolous. Talleyrand
would, no doubt, shudder at the coarseness of
Napoleon’s language at times and cannot have been
blind to his ambition. But the latter coincided as
yet with the interest of France, and the former was
almost obliterated in the glare of his genius. When
we consider the vast work that Napoleon was doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
for France, and the very probable effect a restoration
of the King at that period would have had, we feel
that Talleyrand must have clung to him with real
anxiety.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Napoleon would take care to
attach to his person and cause a minister of the
ability of Talleyrand. To the end of his career he
acknowledged that Talleyrand had no equal in his
work, and their letters show that “foreign ministry”
was taken in a wide sense. Talleyrand could entertain
returned nobles who despised the thin polish
of the Tuileries, as well as play with a St. Julien,
or conciliate Swiss and Italian patriots. To one
letter Talleyrand appends a list of the ladies at his
last soirée who did not dance. When the Spanish
princes came to Paris, it was Talleyrand’s fête at
Neuilly that remained in their memories; it was at
Neuilly they met the old nobility and culture of France,
and enjoyed the most brilliant display of Parisian
decorative art. When Napoleon wanted to have himself
appointed President of the Italian Republic it was Talleyrand
he sent to meet the 450 stern Italian patriots at
Lyons, who would not venture nearer into the mesmeric
circle of the Tuileries. Talleyrand describes the state
of the roads, the price of bread and the feeling of the
provincials, as he travels; selects his friend Melzi among
the deputies to “open his heart to”; puts before them
in his grave, sententious way “not what Napoleon
desired, but what it was expedient for the Cisalpine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>Republic to ask.”<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> When Napoleon and Josephine
arrived, it was almost superfluous to awe the Italians with
reviews and parades. The Constitution was accepted,
and the Italian branch of Napoleon’s empire created.
When, in the summer of 1801, Spain made its “orange-war”
on Portugal, instead of subjugating it as Napoleon
had demanded, the First Consul sent the whole of the
papers to Talleyrand who was at the baths of Bourbon
l’Archambault. “I fear my advice has a smack of the
douche and cold bath about it,” says Talleyrand in
reply; but his moderate and judicious scheme saved the
angry Napoleon from a serious blunder. The news
of Spain’s interested failure to close Portugal against
England had come to Napoleon in the midst of his
negotiation for peace with London, and he talked of
making war on Spain. Talleyrand urged the more
refined punishment of disposing of Trinidad to England,
sending Lucien (the Madrid ambassador) on a long visit
to Cadiz, and of generally “wasting time at Madrid
and pushing things on at London.”<br /><br /></p>

<p class="caption">TALLEYRAND<br />

(Under Napoleon).</p></div>


<p>Peace with England was, in fact, the next measure
that the interest of France demanded. In March, 1801,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>overtures were made from England. Pitt had fallen
over the Catholic Emancipation proposals, and the new
ministry under Addington desired to close the war.
Now that Napoleon had crushed Austria, cajoled Spain,
and conciliated Russia, he would prefer to attempt a
blow at his great enemy, but the news from abroad
moderated his ambition. From St. Petersburg came
the announcement that the Tsar had “died of
apoplexy.” He had been murdered in a palace-conspiracy
on March 23rd. Napoleon vented his feelings
in the customary rhetoric. Talleyrand lifted his eyebrows
and said, “Apoplexy again? It is time they
invented a new disease in Russia.” Immediately afterwards
came the report of the English victory at
Copenhagen, and the detachment of Denmark; and about
the same time bad news reached Paris from Egypt.
Shortly afterwards Bonaparte is described by Stapfer as
saying to the British Ambassador at Paris: “There are only
two nations in the world, England and France. Civilisation
would perish without them. They must be united.”</p>

<p>One cannot claim that Talleyrand did much more
than clerical work in the negotiations that led to the
Peace of Amiens, though he entered into it with more
than usual ardour. Napoleon’s temporary and insincere
cry for a peaceful co-operation of the Mistress of the
Sea and the Mistress of the Land expressed Talleyrand’s
habitual feeling<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>. He did desire to see a naval
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>supremacy of France in the Mediterranean, but he
would leave the high seas to England, with a hope that
free trade would still favour France’s commerce and
colonising adventures. It was, therefore, with a real
sense of triumph that he saw France conclude a most
advantageous peace at a moment when a change of
policy seemed possible in Russia. Joseph Bonaparte
again conducted the negotiations. The preliminaries
were signed on October 1st, 1801, and the Treaty of
Amiens was ratified on March 27th. England had
imprudently relied on certain verbal promises of Otto
in signing the preliminaries, and these were, of course,
disavowed by Talleyrand. “Make plenty of promises
but put nothing on paper,” is a very frequent charge
from him and Napoleon to envoys. The integrity of
of Portugal was guaranteed. Egypt was assigned to the
Turks, and Malta to the Knights of St. John. France
gave to England the islands of Trinidad and Ceylon
(which did not belong to her), and obtained recognition
of her extension into Italy and Germany. The diplomatic
reputation of the Bonapartes and Talleyrand rose
to a great height at Paris, where the advantages gained
were discussed with astonishment. As Mr. Rose puts
it: “With three exceptions England had given way on
every point of importance since the first declaration of
her claims.”</p>

<p>Towards the close of March Talleyrand presented
himself to Napoleon one morning for the usual discussion
of business. When it was all over he calmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
produced the Treaty of Amiens! But he was far from
insensible of the height to which France had risen since
the end of 1799. The flood of allied armies that had
dashed against her frontiers for seven or eight years
had now ebbed impotently away. Her territory reached
to more natural boundaries, and her influence was felt
far beyond them&mdash;in Holland, Germany, Switzerland,
Italy and Spain. There seemed some hope at last of
that internal organisation which France so sorely needed.
And Bonaparte’s ideal went very largely on the lines
of Talleyrand’s own schemes. His great address on
education was exhumed; his financial proposals were
followed more than once in the restoration of fiscal
health to the country. Nor would Talleyrand have any
sympathy with the opposition to Napoleon’s creation of
the Legion of Honour. “Toys!” said Napoleon, when
someone spoke lightly of his distribution of ribands:
“Well, you keep men in order with toys.” It was
a not unhappy mean between the old hereditary
gradation of society, with its demoralising and
irritating narrowness, and the crude “equality” of
the Revolution.</p>

<p>When, therefore, the proposal of a life Consulship
was put before Paris by Napoleon’s instruments, Talleyrand
had no reason to demur to it. The benevolent despot
was his ideal of government for France. Besides, who
<i>could</i> succeed Napoleon? Who else could give form
and substance to the fair vision of France that had
arisen before the minds of thoughtful men? To talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
of Talleyrand “deserting” the principles of the
Revolution which he had embraced is mere verbiage.
He had never believed that pure democracy would be
permanent or practicable in an uneducated nation.
There did not seem to him on that account any reason
why he should sit idly beyond the frontiers, living on
an English pension, until others would lead France again
into the paths of destiny. So when Cambacérès hinted
that the work of the First Consul merited a peculiar
recognition, he felt no repugnance. The obsequious
Senate proposed a Consulship for ten years, and
Napoleon disdainfully ignored it. Then the idea of a
life-Consulship was put to the country in a plebiscite,
and carried by an imposing majority.</p>

<p>In the long and complete negotiations that followed
the peace Talleyrand was very active. His detractors
had the alternative of ignoring his action altogether,
and reducing him to the inglorious rank of first clerk of
the Foreign Office, or of assigning to him a very
considerable activity with a proportionate “corruption.”
The truth is that during 1802-3 Talleyrand was very
busy, and his work was lucrative. Once more, however,
there is no charge that he sold the interest of France
or of peace. In those last days of the buccaneering
period the great Powers regarded helpless little States as
a providential means of compensating each other. Poland
had been coldly dismembered. Turkey in Europe was
freely subjected to plans, as it still is. Holland, Hanover,
and a score of other places were pawns on the board. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
was understood that after the peace the possesssions of
the ecclesiastical princes on the Rhine should be put on
the market. The hotel of the Foreign Minister at
Paris was besieged with princes and their envoys. Baron
von Gagern tells how he saw Luchesini, Cobentzl, and
others playing with Talleyrand’s adopted daughter,
Charlotte, and her lap-dog.</p>

<p>Prussia was the first to be rewarded for her
benevolent neutrality and her silence in view of the
invasion of Italy. Bavaria, Wurtemberg, Hesse, Baden,
and the House of Orange were indemnified out of ecclesiastical
property. Vienna saw its legendary “empire”
break up without the power of murmuring. Austria
itself and the Grand Duke of Tuscany absorbed more
of the ecclesiastical domains. The cession of the left
bank of the Rhine to France had created the need for
indemnities. France, with the ready consent of Europe,
covered her aggression by dividing the right bank
among the dispossessed princes and the Powers. At
the Hotel Galiffet and at St. Cloud the map of Europe
was assiduously used. Little squares of territory with
few guns and troops changed colour rapidly. There
were believed to be men and women in them.</p>

<p>Then there were the southern odd parts of the map
to be settled. Switzerland had invited the interference
of a strong hand by her constant anarchy. Napoleon
was not unwilling to play the part of mediator, and clip
off the province containing the road to Italy. The
sturdy Swiss patriot, Stapfer, has left us the long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
correspondence with which he reported to his authorities
the dreary two years he spent at Paris. In one of his
letters he says to Talleyrand: “I shall feel gratified and
honoured throughout life that I have been in touch with
you who have brought the light and the urbanity of
the old regime into the new, and who have proved that
all the results of social advance and of the culture of the
first ranks of society may be completely reconciled with
democratic principles.” It is just to add that this is a
prelude to a very solid “but.” However, Stapfer
acknowledged in the end that Napoleon’s mediation in
Switzerland had done good. Luchesini tells us that
when Napoleon asked Talleyrand to secure his nomination
to the presidency of the Swiss Republic, as he had
done with the Italians at Lyons, the Foreign Minister at
once threatened to resign. Piedmont had been incorporated
as a French province by a <i>senatus consultum</i> in
September. Genoa and Lucca had been granted
“constitutions.” Elba had sent three deputies to Paris,
where they were entertained as princes and given a
<i>douceur</i> of 3,000 francs each; and Elba was incorporated
into the growing empire.</p>

<p>In two years the Foreign Office had negotiated
treaties with Austria, Russia, Prussia, Bavaria and
England, redistributed all the small principalities of the
Rhine valley, and prepared constitutions for Lucca,
Genoa, Elba, Piedmont and Switzerland. Many
princes, provinces and free towns gained by the changes:
many escaped losses that seemed only too imminent:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
many lost less than they might have done. It is probable
enough that Talleyrand accepted from these sums of
money that were collectively respectable. A few cases
are put on reliable record. There is not the least reason
to doubt that in most cases of advantage conferred the
Foreign Minister was ready to receive money. He
freely expressed his disposition. <i>Cadeau diplomatique</i>
was a familiar and not dishonourable phrase of the day.
“I have given nothing to St. Julien,” Talleyrand wrote
to Napoleon, “because all the Directory jewellery is out
of date.” On another occasion he urges Napoleon to
give a substantial sum of money to the Spanish Minister.
No doubt, the present usually took the form of a piece
of jewellery <i>worth</i> money. “Talleyrand preferred cash,”
says von Gagern, indulgently. It saved trouble. When
we regard the enormous quantity of negotiations and
settlements thrown on Talleyrand by Napoleon’s plans,
it is difficult to feel surprise that he made some millions
of francs. His action does not invite our admiration,
but we may bear in mind that in not a single case is he
known to have strained or deserted his duty for money,
and that more than half the specific charges against him
will not sustain examination.</p>

<p>To complete the picture of the extraordinary
activity of Napoleon and Talleyrand at this time we
must notice its range beyond Europe. Treaties were
concluded with Turkey, Algeria and Tunis. Napoleon’s
mind found time to interest itself in Australia, India,
America and the West Indies. After the peace of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
Amiens he took up the idea of colonies as “safety
valves” for the over-strained and over-populated nation
which Talleyrand had put forward under the Directory.
But Talleyrand seems to have been little more than a
clerk in the not very honourable pursuit of this plan.
Napoleon sent out his ill-fated army to St. Domingo
with a message to Toussaint l’Ouverture that it was
coming to help him. At the same time he directed
Talleyrand to inform England that it was going to
destroy the native government, and hint that it might
restore the slave trade; while Bruix and others were
pointing out to the dazed new democracy in France
that slavery had been fully recognised by those
admirable models of theirs, the “free peoples of
antiquity.” In 1801 he made Talleyrand assure Spain
that Louisiana, which Spain ceded to him, would never
be given to a third Power. It is on record that
Talleyrand firmly opposed him when he unscrupulously
sold it to the United States two years later. Expeditions
to India and to Australia complete the gigantic
programme of their activity, save for the important
work of reconciliation with Catholicism which may open
a new chapter.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">THE RESTORATION OF RELIGION</span></p>


<p>Napoleon’s imperial vision included in its first vague
outline the restoration of the Church in France and the
establishment of good relations with Rome. The sharpness
of his earlier antagonism to religion was worn down
by his experience and his political requirements. Let
the old clergy overrun the provinces of France again,
and they would soon exorcise them of their superficial
Jacobinism. He had seen in the East how despotism
throve where it had the support of religion. The new
Pope, Pius VII, should be disposed to make a bargain
with the new Charlemagne. Not only did France seem
still to drift away from Catholicism, but the spirit of
Gallicanism had passed over the Rhine and the Pyrenees.
Alarming rumours of the founding of “national”
churches came to the Vatican from Spain and South
Germany; while Catholic Austria held aloof with an
open cupidity for the Pope’s temporal dominions.
So the Corsican free-thinker converted himself into
“Charlemagne.” The Pope might be reminded of the
spiritual desolation that cried for his spiritual intervention
in France; ultramontanism could be made
innocuous by the simple expedient of abolishing the
mountains, and making a Catholic Constantinople of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
Paris; the police would be seconded by the subtler
gendarmery of the clergy, the heads of which would be
ingeniously fitted into the political machinery of the
country. Before Napoleon left Italy (after Marengo)
he sent the Bishop of Vercelli to the Pope with a
message of peace.</p>

<p>Talleyrand had already written to the Vatican in
the same feeling, at the direction of the First Consul.
Mr. Holland Rose and many other writers entirely
misunderstand Talleyrand’s share in the work of religious
pacification, because they have a quite false idea of
his attitude towards the Church. I interpret the negative
evidence to mean that Talleyrand was agnostic rather
than deistic, in spite of his admiration for Voltaire and
his dislike of Diderot and d’Holbach. But he was an
agnostic Liberal statesman of a type familiar in France
(and many other countries) down to our own time. He
never attacked or ridiculed religion. He believed the
Church to be a useful agency among the mass of the
people, provided it was earnest and spiritual, and did
not meddle with politics beyond promising eternal
torment to the more violent radicals. Of this we have
evidence enough even in his speeches of 1790-1792.
He would not at all resent Napoleon’s proposals, if
Napoleon would firmly maintain the rights of the constitutional
clergy. There is not a particle of evidence
that raises any difficulty as to Talleyrand’s attitude.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>
<p>He is nowhere found with the angry soldiers and
politicians who thought the revolution had made a
French Church an anachronism, and who filled Paris
with fresh murmurs at the idea of a Concordat.</p>

<p>Towards the end of 1800, Paris had a new fact
to proceed on in its cafés. The Vatican had sent
Mgr. Spina, the Papal Nuncio at Florence, to confer
with Talleyrand and Napoleon. The sagacious priest
did not flaunt his purple, merely announcing that the
Archbishop of Corinth had come to treat with Napoleon
on matters concerning the administration of Rome. But
the religious controversy had revived in France, and
the appearance of a papal envoy fanned the flame. The
relaxation of the laws had introduced a large number
of the emigrant clergy, and these contended everywhere
with the Constitutionalists for the care of souls and of
presbyteries. The confusion was increased by the
Theophilanthropists, who claimed the sacred edifices of
the country in the superior name of virtue, and asked
the people to bow to their august abstractions. After
a mass they would decorate Catholic altars with flowers
in honour of morality, and they showed no lack of
courage in defending their fair ideals. Philosophic
deists and quick-witted atheists smiled on the confusion.
But all eyes were now centred on the pale and portly
prelate who sat in long conference with the ex-bishop
at the Foreign Office.</p>

<p>Mgr. Spina had been generally directed to avoid
the excommunicated apostates, but to moderate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
rigour of the Canon Law when “urbanity” demanded.
“Urbanity” clearly involved amiable relations with Talleyrand,
and the suave, serious tone of the diplomatist at
once disarmed the Italian. Talleyrand would “very soon
return to the Church,” Spina wrote to Rome. Napoleon,
however, had another agent at hand for this negotiation.
He had retained the Breton priest, Bernier, at Paris, and
now used him as a foil against the astute Italian. The
Pope’s temporal possessions, the Legations, were the
central difficulty in the negotiations that followed.
Pius VII was pledged to work for their restoration;
Napoleon had no intention whatever of restoring them.
Talleyrand clearly stated this position, and then allowed
the abbé and the archbishop to expend their diplomatic
talent over the <i>impasse</i> for a month or two. At last a
draft of a Concordat was submitted to Rome, the First
Consul sending with it the unexacting but precious
present of the wooden statue of Our Lady of Loretto,
which the revolutionary troops had brought from Italy,
and telling his envoy to “treat the Pope as if he had
200,000 soldiers.” It was an original standard of
spiritual respect.</p>

<p>But Talleyrand’s interest in the constitutional clergy
of France&mdash;Napoleon is reported to have called them “a
pack of dishonourable brigands”&mdash;found expression in
the Concordat. The Pope was requested to secure the
resignation of the orthodox emigrant bishops, so as to
begin the foundation of the new church on a clear
ground. The unhappy Pope was forced at length to ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
this resignation, and the emigrant clergy cast off all
restraint, and a good deal of theology, when the invitation
reached them. While forty-five of them agreed to do so
a large number sent a fiery and defiant reply to the Pope.
Pamphlets circulated at London and at Rome in which
priests described Pius VII as a Jew, or Judas, and
declared it to be blasphemy to mention his name in the
mass. The prospects of Catholicism in England had to
be reassured by a counter fulmination from twenty-nine
Irish Catholic Bishops and English Vicars Apostolic. At
the same time the Pope was told that he must sanction
the national appropriation of the estates of the Church in
France. “The difficulties you raise,” Talleyrand wrote
to Rome, “are imaginary. The Church has been
stripped of her possessions in every age, and the
despoilers have never been touched&mdash;unless weak.” And
as the Vatican still lingered over these formidable
demands Napoleon angrily summoned Talleyrand,
Bernier, and Spina to Malmaison, formulated his ultimatum,
and declared that if Rome did not comply within
five days he would throw it over and erect a national
Church.</p>

<p>On the fifth day the Pope’s Secretary of State,
Cardinal Consalvi, was in Paris. He had left Rome
placarded with the florid denunciations of the Pope by
the emigrant bishops; he found Paris holding a congress
of the constitutional bishops, who denounced the
Concordat with equally lively rhetoric from their own
point of view. The Pope was profoundly dejected and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
miserable; the First Consul was radiantly surveying
the universe from the height of success; Talleyrand
was wearying of the futile resistance of the Romans.
Consalvi brought every weapon from the diplomatic
arsenal of the Vatican. Thinking he understood
Talleyrand, he said to him: “People make me out to
be a pietist. I’m nothing of the kind. I like pleasure
as well as anyone.” But Talleyrand did not admire
Consalvi’s diplomacy. After a few days he sent him a
final draft of a Concordat, and left Paris to take the
waters at Bourbon l’Archambault. Mr. Holland Rose
puts it that “the polite scoffer, the bitter foe of all
clerical claims, found it desirable to take the baths at a
distant place, and left the threads of the negotiation in
the hands of two men who were equally determined to
prevent its signature.” I have already pointed out
that Talleyrand never scoffed at religion, and was not
at all a foe, “bitter” or otherwise, of clerical claims of
a non-political character. Further, Talleyrand left
Paris, firstly, because it was his custom to go to the
baths about this time, and secondly because he <i>wanted</i>
the Concordat signed without further palaver. As a
fact, Consalvi expressed satisfaction that Talleyrand was
out of the way at the moment of signing. Talleyrand,
again, was bound to leave his functions in the charge
of d’Hauterive, his second in command, and the belief
that d’Hauterive was “equally determined to prevent
signature” is an equally unjust inference from the
mere fact of his being an ex-cleric. In fine, the story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
that the chiefs of the Foreign Office tried to trick
Consalvi into signing a draft materially differing from
the one they had given him, is only mentioned by
Consalvi, and has been gravely questioned by some
writers.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p>The Concordat was signed by Consalvi and Joseph
Bonaparte on the night of July 15-16. Consalvi
admitted to his friends that he had been empowered to
make even greater concessions than he had been forced
to do, and attributed his comparative success to the
absence of Talleyrand. But before he left Paris Talleyrand
returned from the south, and at once pointed out
to Napoleon the unsatisfactory features of the Concordat.
The chief of these was that it contained no recognition
of the constitutional clergy or of the married and
secularised ex-priests. Rome was just as eager to ignore
or punish these as Talleyrand was to defend them; and
the First Consul was inclined to sacrifice them to the
general agreement. But Talleyrand insisted on a recognition
of their status; it is in this connection that
Consalvi describes him as a “powerful opponent,” not
with the implication that he is a “bitter foe” of clerical
claims generally. Consalvi again fruitlessly struggled
against the Foreign Minister. On August 29th Talleyrand
was able to report to Napoleon that “the Holy See
had sanctioned, without any material reserve, the results
of the negotiations of its ministers&mdash;had, in fact, done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>more, as it had given the name of bishops and archbishops
to the titular prelates of the constitutional
clergy.” He had threatened that France would not
ratify the convention if the Vatican attempted to stigmatise
in any way the clergy or ex-clergy of the country,
but he permitted it the luxury of referring to their wives
as “corrupt women,” and was content to suppress, as far
as possible, the Brief containing the phrase.</p>

<p>The Concordat became law in April, 1802. The
only people who murmured against it were, says
Talleyrand, “a few soldiers&mdash;very brave fellows, but
with minds too narrow to admit a conception of that
kind.” The phrase clearly indicates his view of it.
Broad-mindedness and a desire for peaceful social
advance recommended the measure. It put an end to
the unseemly squabble over churches and presbyteries,
and ended the ridiculous confusion of the Republican
day of rest (<i>décadi</i>&mdash;every ten days) and the Sabbath. It
reconciled the Catholic feeling that still existed in the
country (though this is sometimes grossly exaggerated)
with the Napoleonic regime. Talleyrand would be the
last to wish to sacrifice these solid advantages to a
sentimental rationalism. He is one of the chief architects
and builders of the Concordat.</p>

<p>A few months after the ratification of the Concordat
Talleyrand was “secularised” by the Pope. This
procedure has somewhat mystified his biographers, and
as a fact it was a mere empty form, another concession
of the Vatican to the perversity of the age. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
Catholic principles the Pope <i>cannot</i> annul the priestly
character; he <i>may</i> release the priest from his vow of
celibacy. Pius VII affected to do the former, but
cleverly refrained from doing the latter, for Talleyrand.
His letter, dated June 29th, 1802, and addressed to
“our very dear son,” ran: “We were overjoyed at
learning of your ardent desire to be reconciled with us
and the Catholic Church. Hence, extending our fatherly
love to you, we relieve you, in the fulness of our power,
from the bond of all the excommunications, and grant
you liberty to wear secular costume and to administer all
civil affairs, whether in the office you now fill or in
others to which your Government may call you.” The
statement that Talleyrand thought this secularisation
would leave him free to marry, and had asked for it, is
ridiculous. The Vatican has only annulled the priestly
vow of celibacy twice in the course of its history, though
it professes to have full power to do so in any case. It
was Napoleon who asked the Pope to secularise
Talleyrand. Excommunications sat lightly enough on
the ex-bishop; and he would, no doubt, keenly appreciate
the “paternal charity” of the Pope in “reconciling”
him by removing his excommunication and
gravely admitting him to secular employment, while
carefully refraining from noticing his notorious domestic
relations and his infidelity.</p>

<p>Napoleon, apparently, had a large idea of the
privileges he had secured for Talleyrand, and he presently
put great pressure on him to marry Mme. Grand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
Talleyrand does not seem to have cared at all for
going through the meaningless ceremony. He knew
he was not free to marry from the ecclesiastical point of
view, and a civil contract would not in any case alter his
relations to the lady of his choice. However, Mme.
Grand felt that the form of marriage would improve her
position. The etiquette of the Tuileries was developing
once more. There was, one observer says, “not exactly
a Court, but no longer a camp.” She appealed to
Napoleon through Josephine, and Talleyrand was forced
to go through the ceremony of marriage. The civil
function was performed on September 10th, 1803, and
the Church graciously blessed the diplomatic marriage
on the following day. In the spiteful mood of later
years Napoleon spoke of the marriage he had himself
brought about as a “a triumph of immorality.” He
seems to have discovered at St. Helena that in Catholic
eyes a priest is “a priest for ever”; and he contrives to
forget that Mme. Grand was not a “married woman”
but a <i>divorcée</i>.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> The story runs that the first time she
appeared at a levee after the marriage the Emperor
thought fit to express a hope that “the good conduct of
Citoyenne Talleyrand would help them to forget the
escapades of Mme. Grand.” She replied that, with
the example of Citoyenne Bonaparte before her, she
would do her best.</p>

<p>By this time the heavy diplomatic work that followed
the treaties of Lunéville and Amiens was over, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>German princes had ceased (for the time) to struggle for
the debris of the Holy Roman Empire. Talleyrand
found himself in a position of great wealth, and with one
or two years of comparative leisure. His official
residence, a large mansion built under the old regime by
a rich colonist, was the Hotel Galiffet in the Rue
St. Dominique. He had wandered far since the day
when he began his public life in a small house of the
same street in 1778, but the tense experiences of those
fifteen years had made little change in him. The
Revolution and the exile might never have occurred.
His principles were unchanged, his wit as keen as ever,
his light cynicism not a shade less amiable, his fine taste
for books, for food, or for society unimpaired. Lytton
describes him at this time reclining, day by day, on a
couch near the fire in his salon<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> and entertaining a
brilliant circle of visitors. His chief Parisian friends at
this time were Montrond, the Duc de Laval, Sainte-Foix,
General Duroc, Colonel Beauharnais, Louis,
Dalberg, and others of the wittier and more cultured
men of the time. The dress and manners of the
Revolution were now never seen in polite society. The
artificial fraternity of the past, with its “thou” and
“citizen,” was abandoned. Men ceased to be brothers
and became friends once more. The long military coat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>and high boots and the tricolor were kept in the camp.
The old life was being silently restored. Supple, graceful
figures in Bourbon coats, with light rapiers dangling, and
long silk hose and buckled shoes, trod the polished floors
with confidence. Nature had been thrust out with a fork.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="caption">TALLEYRAND<br />

(Under Napoleon).</p></div>





<p>Talleyrand’s hotel was the chief centre of the
revival. People of taste went to the Tuileries as they
went to church or to business. There was little gaiety
there. Napoleon, who certainly could talk well, was
habitually gloomy and retired; and one had an uneasy
consciousness of his temper and his command of language
that is not found in the dictionary. His family and the
family of his wife were already in bitter antagonism
around him as to the succession to the coming empire.
Josephine had displayed, possibly even felt, a tardy
devotion to him as his genius fully revealed itself, but
she had now herself to bemoan an infidelity which she
conceived in the most sombre colours; and Napoleon,
with proof about him of his own fertility, bitterly dwelt
on her barrenness. His brothers did not tend to relieve
his depression. He could not fondle the pretty son of
Louis but the latter would flash forth an angry suspicion
of an incestuous relation to Hortense. Lucien and
Jerome would not be content to seduce, but must
disgrace the family by marrying, two charming nobodies.
It is a well known story how on one occasion, when
Napoleon was giving a sedate family party, from which
Mme. Tallien and other lively friends of Josephine were
excluded, a message was handed to the First Consul, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
he burst forth with a violent and inelegant complaint that
“Lucien had married his mistress”&mdash;to give a polite
turn to the phrase.</p>

<p>At Talleyrand’s house there was neither restraint
nor affectation. Lord Brougham tells us that “nothing
could be more perfect than Talleyrand’s temper and
disposition in private life.” Mme. Rémusat affirms
that Talleyrand had quickly regretted his choice, but
that talkative lady did not love Mme. Talleyrand. The
malicious biographers are generally content to give us
piquant stories of her lack of culture. One of the chief
of these&mdash;the protean story of her taking Sir George
Robinson for Robinson Crusoe, or Denou for the
author of Defoe’s work&mdash;has been completely discredited
by Pichot, an authority on legends. There
are more authentic, but less interesting, stories of
her ignorance, which must certainly have bored Talleyrand
at times. On the whole, the evidence seems to
indicate&mdash;especially on its negative side&mdash;that they lived
pleasantly and faithfully together for many years. The
wife was, unfortunately, childless. As Talleyrand deeply
loved children this must have been a source of great
disappointment. He alleviated it by adopting the
daughter of a friend who had died in England, and
children’s balls were frequently given at his hotel.</p>

<p>It was not unnatural that as soon as Napoleon felt
his conduct and person to be secretly assailed with
witticisms and criticisms he should look to Talleyrand’s
hotel for the chief source. There was so much in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
melodramatic poses to make the hated Faubourg St.
Germain smile. Baron von Gagern tells us of the
keen rivalry to enter Talleyrand’s circle. Those who
had the <i>entrée</i> went there after the opera at night, and
played whist or billiards until two or three in the
morning. “It was,” says Lord Brougham, “a lesson
and a study, as well as a marvel, to see him disconcert
with a look of his keen eyes, or a motion of his chin,
a whole piece of wordy talk.” When a rumour spread
of the death of George III, a Parisian banker came
rather impertinently to ask his opinion. “Well,” said
Talleyrand, gravely, “some say he is dead and some
say he is not. I may tell you in confidence that I don’t
believe either.” On another occasion a general of no
great culture turned up late for dinner, and began to
explain that a “maudit pékin” had detained him.
Talleyrand asked him what a <i>pékin</i> was. He replied
that it was a camp-phrase for “all that isn’t military.”
“Oh! I see,” said Talleyrand. “Just as we call
military all that is not civil.”</p>

<p>Dulness was the deadly sin at the Hotel Galiffet.
When a not very handsome Englishman was boring the
company one day with a long description of the charms
of his mother, Talleyrand broke in at the first gap: “It
must have been your father, then, who was not very
good-looking.” He talked little, as a rule. Sometimes
he would sit for an hour without speaking, then make
a short and brilliant shot, in his sepulchral voice, at
something that had been said. When Chateaubriand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
whom he very much despised, had published his “Les
Martyrs,” a friend gave Talleyrand a very long account
of the plot of the work, concluding with the remark that
the heroes were “thrown to the beasts.” “Like the
book,” said Talleyrand, bitterly. When another man
observed to him that Fouché had a great contempt for
humanity, he said: “Yes, he had studied himself very
carefully.” Another had the imprudence to ask him
what had passed at a Council he had attended. “Three
hours,” said Talleyrand. When he heard that Sémonville,
for whom he had little respect, was getting fat, he
pretended to be mystified, and explained that he “did
not see how it was to Sémonville’s interest to get stout.”
It was of the same man that he afterwards said, when
Sémonville had become a senator, and someone was
urging that “there were at all events consciences in the
Senate”; “Oh! yes. Sémonville alone has at least
two.” There was hardly a prominent person in Paris
who did not go about with one or two of these barbs in
him. It is well to remember them when we read their
comments on him in their memoirs. Sometimes the
quips actually came to be applied to himself. A friend,
rather a <i>roué</i>, met him one day, and complained that he
felt “infernal pains” (<i>douleurs d’enfer</i>). “Already?”
said Talleyrand. It was pretended in later years that
this pretty dialogue passed between himself and Louis
Philippe, when he was dying. But Talleyrand could
say sweet things as well as bitter on the spur of the
moment. It is well known how, when he was challenged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
to say which of two ladies at table (Mme. de Staël and
Mme. Grand or another) he would rescue from the
water first, he turned to one and said: “You are able
to swim.” So when Napoleon asked him very pointedly
how he became rich: “I bought stock on the 18th
Brumaire, and sold it the next day.” On another
occasion, when Napoleon told him he was removing his
study to a higher storey, he at once replied: “Naturally,
you are bound to live high up.”</p>

<p>His attitude towards the First Consul remained
loyal and cordial in spite of the occasional strain put on
it. I will resume in the next chapter the thread of his
official duties, and will deal here with two important
events that occurred before war again broke out.
The first is the murder of the Duc d’Enghien, in
connection with which Talleyrand has been judged so
severely.</p>

<p>There is at this hour of the day, and in default of
fresh discoveries of documents, nothing new to be said
about the pitiful tragedy of 1804. Happily, the progress
of research on the matter has tended to exculpate Talleyrand.
Writers so wholly devoid of sympathy with him
as Mr. Holland Rose now say that the allegations against
him are “sufficiently disposed of by the ex-Emperor’s
will.” Napoleon with his last words took full responsibility
for the tragedy, and declared he would do it again
in similar circumstances. The only question is how far
Talleyrand lent assistance in the execution of Napoleon’s
purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span></p>

<p>By the end of 1803 the First Consul was driven
by his dread of plots into a condition that excited
the horror of beholders. Spies and guards constantly
surrounded him. Paroxysms of rage by day and
sleepless nights wore his nerves and embittered his spirit.
The failure of the plot of Georges and Pichegru only
served to exasperate him against the Royalist plotters,
and he swore to execute the first Bourbon that fell into
his hands. When, therefore, a rumour spread that a
Bourbon prince had been in Paris in connection with the
plot to assassinate him, and the Duc d’Enghien, living
only a few miles beyond the frontier, was the only one
to whom the rumour could possibly apply, Napoleon
turned his thoughts vindictively towards the young
prince. The suspicion was increased by positive information
received that the Duke had applied for service
against France in the English army. A little later a
secret agent reported that d’Enghien was conferring
with Royalist officers with a view to invading France if
the assassination of Napoleon was effected; and when
application was made to the Prefect of Strassburg he
forwarded a report that the ex-General Dumouriez was
with the Duke at Ettenheim. A simple confusion of
the names Thumery and Dumouriez thus offered a
strong confirmation of the suspicion.</p>

<p>All that Talleyrand had done so far was to write a
protest to the Elector of Baden against the use of his
territory for conspiracy. The critical moment came
when Napoleon summoned him and the other ministers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
the two Consuls, and Fouché, to a council on the matter.
At that council it was decided to violate the territory of
Baden, and arrest the Duke; the rest was inevitable.
What was the attitude of Talleyrand? His accuser is
Savary, a bitter enemy, and a writer who is found time
after time to distort his narrative in the interest of his
prejudices. Savary says that Talleyrand urged that the
duke “be arrested and settled with.” He gives this on
the authority of two documents. The first is the
memoirs of Cambacérès (one of the Consuls present,
also an enemy of Talleyrand), which have never seen the
light, and which, in fact, Savary did not care to invoke
till Cambacérès was dead, as he “did not like to mention
his name while he was still alive.” The other document
purports to be an abstract of the speech that Talleyrand
delivered on the occasion. All Talleyrand’s enemies
have built their charge against him on this document.
It is a forged document. In this case we have the
confession of the forger himself, Talleyrand’s mischievous
ex-secretary, Perrey. Thus there is not a particle of
serious evidence that Talleyrand urged either the arrest
or the execution. Such an act would be violently inconsistent
with his character. We should require the most
positive evidence before admitting it. As a fact, we are
invited to believe it on the ground of an acknowledged
fabrication and a reference by a malignant enemy to
another document which no one else has ever seen.</p>

<p>Talleyrand told Mme. Rémusat that he knew
Napoleon was absolutely bent on destroying the Duke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
and striking terror into the Bourbons, and so he said
nothing. The careful student of his character must feel
that that is just what he would do. “The best principle
is not to have any at all,” he once said with a laugh.
He meant that in such cases as this a virtuous protest
would do no good whatever, and did not seem worth
the torrent of anger it would provoke. We may not
admire such prudence, but we must be just to it.
Talleyrand could and did protest, before and after this
date, when he believed something might be done.</p>

<p>Talleyrand admits that after the Council he wrote
three letters at the direction of Napoleon, giving
instructions for the arrest, or in connection with it. He
says that this was a “painful necessity.” The critic could
only suggest here that he ought to have resigned, which
no one seems to have thought of doing at the time.
Another memoir writer of the time, Pasquier, who is
hostile to Talleyrand, says that “a lady” heard the
Foreign Minister reply to a question about the Duke:
“He will be shot.” It is a mere <i>on dit</i>, but it would not
be strange for Talleyrand to have predicted that issue.
Savary builds a good deal on a visit that Talleyrand paid
to the Governor of Paris after the duke had been brought
there. But the object of this is clear. The carriage
containing the unfortunate prisoner had been driven by
mistake to Talleyrand’s hotel, and he had to see the
governor about its further direction. It left immediately
for Vincennes, and the tragedy was carried to its close.
Talleyrand has nothing to do with the last and darkest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
scenes, but Savary is deeply implicated. The statement
that Talleyrand detained, until it was too late, the Duke’s
request for an interview has been refuted long ago. On
the other hand, Napoleon’s statement that he was unaware
of the Duke’s existence until Talleyrand began to suggest
the crime has been proved to be untrue, and is virtually
retracted by Napoleon’s later and bolder expressions.</p>

<p>Thus when we bring the charge against Talleyrand
down to its real proportions, it means that he did not
protest against the execution in advance, and did not
resign when it was accomplished. It seems clear that
he did not regard the event with any horror at the
time, and that he really did to some undefined extent
regard it as, if not a political necessity, at least an
effective political measure. Resignation on account of it
was out of the question. He said to someone who
suggested it: “If Bonaparte has committed a crime, that
is no reason I should make a mistake.” We who judge
these things dissect them out of their living texture, and
set them under our ethical glasses in placid studies. It
would be well, perhaps, to put ourselves in the place of a
statesman who was a daily witness of the frightful
condition into which plotters had thrown Napoleon,
and who felt how much the peace of the country was
overclouded by Bourbon and English conspirators.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>It would be ingenuous to trace any feeling or lack
of feeling in Talleyrand’s conduct after the execution.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>It was his diplomatic duty to kill the feeling of disgust
in others, whatever he felt himself. He had not a difficult
task. The ball he gave immediately afterwards was well
attended; amongst others the envoy of the Neapolitan
Bourbons was there. The Spanish Bourbons shrugged
their shoulders, and said it was a pity the Duke had
drawn it on himself. Prussia and Austria were without
difficulty persuaded to take no notice of the affair. The
King of Sweden was disposed to interfere, but Talleyrand
sent word to him that “as France did not meddle with
Swedish affairs, perhaps Sweden would leave French
matters to France.” When the Czar sent his Court into
mourning, and raised difficulties, Talleyrand met him
with the enquiry whether “at the time when England
was compassing the death of Paul I every effort would
not have been made to have the plotters seized if they
were known to be only a league beyond the frontiers.”
As the murderers of Paul I were the intimate friends of
his son and were retained in honour by him, the inquiry
sufficiently spoiled the dignity of the Russian protest.</p>

<p>One more great event of the year 1804 must be
noticed before we return to foreign affairs. On May 18
Napoleon was declared Emperor. Talleyrand had no
repugnance whatever to the re-introduction of the hereditary
principle or the formal declaration of the autocracy
of Napoleon. He would have preferred the title of king,
but Napoleon had a larger prospect. The change took
place with the full wish of the country, and seemed to be
in its interest. Talleyrand was entrusted with the task<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
of forming the new Court. From the frame of the old
German Empire he borrowed half-a-dozen high-sounding
dignities, and he is said to have been much mortified
when Napoleon failed to bestow one of those on himself.
It is explained that Napoleon did not care to put any
minister in an “immovable” position. He was, however,
made Grand Chamberlain to the new Emperor, receiving
nearly 500,000 francs a year and a much closer association
with Napoleon’s monarchical ways than he cared for. As
Foreign Minister he had the difficult task of inducing
Pius VII to come for the coronation&mdash;“a miracle of
Napoleon’s destiny,” he calls it. In July he accompanied
Napoleon and Josephine to the camp at Boulogne, and
then to Aix la Chapelle, where Napoleon posed as the
modern Charlemagne to a crowd of small German
princes. In November the Pope arrived. The suspicious
pontiff did not feel his apprehensions allayed when, at
their first meeting, Napoleon deliberately tricked him
into taking the second seat in the carriage. Nor was
Napoleon too pleased when Josephine appealed to the
Pope to have her marriage made secure by a religious
ceremony. Cardinal Fesch married them, but the
Bonapartists always held that it was invalid as the parish
priest was not present. When Rogers asked Talleyrand
afterwards whether Napoleon had really married
Josephine, he answered: “Not altogether.”</p>

<p>Talleyrand witnessed the last act in the drama of
the Revolution when, on December 2nd (1804), the
three Bonapartes and Josephine, preceded by Murat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
and twenty brilliant squadrons of cavalry, drove in a
gorgeous chariot to the door of Notre Dame. Where
reason and humanity had been enthroned a few years
before, a glittering pageantry of Church and State now
gathered about the altar for the coronation of a more
absolute autocrat than Louis XVI. A Pope, convinced
in his conscience of the utter impiety and immorality
of Napoleon, solemnly intoned the “Veni, Creator
Spiritus,” and received Napoleon’s profession of faith.
In the interest of peace and of the Church, Pius VII
stooped to acts that nearly broke his heart. And when
the supreme moment came in which he was to crown
Napoleon, and thus assert at length and for ever his
own ascendancy, Napoleon snatched the crown from its
cushion and put it on his own head. For several months
the Pope and his ministers remained at Paris. Talleyrand
speaks in the memoirs with great respect and
sympathy of the Pope, and says that he refused any
presents for his family and asked no advantage of a
material kind for the Church. We know that he did
press for the restoration of the temporal power, and was
met with the mocking assurance that “Napoleon must
keep what God has given him.” So Pius VII returned
to Rome empty-handed, with a bitter consciousness of
his futile sacrifices and compromises.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">THE RENEWAL OF WAR</span></p>


<p>We have now to resume the story of work at the
Foreign Office, and examine&mdash;in so far as Talleyrand
figures in them&mdash;the complicated events that led to the
resumption of hostilities in 1805. The peace with
England had not even an illusory appearance of solidity.
Napoleon described it as “a short armistice;”
George III said it was “an experimental peace.”
Napoleon was irritated when Talleyrand used to say
that he would have been willing to leave Malta to the
English if he could have had the treaty signed by Fox
or Pitt instead of the less clear and resolute Addington.
But whether or no Napoleon himself regarded the
Peace of Amiens as a stage in the conquest of Europe,
it undoubtedly presented itself in that light very shortly.
Once clothed with the Imperial purple, the mantle of
Charlemagne, Napoleon would see the splendid strategic
position he occupied in Europe. We must go back a
little, however, to understand clearly the negotiations
in which Talleyrand was engaged before the second
campaign against Austria.</p>

<p>The pretty theory of sharing the world between
the Mistress of the Sea and the Mistress of the Land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
soon ceased to impose. England was far from willing
to surrender Europe to Napoleon. Such an abandonment
would have meant the closing of all European
ports against her commerce, the closing of the route to
India and a descent upon it through Russia, and the
loss of Egypt. She therefore watched Napoleon
closely in Europe, and clung to Malta on the plea that
it was to have been put under the guarantee of the six
Powers and four of them would not now carry out the
agreement. Thiers blames Talleyrand for not securing
this action on the part of Russia, Prussia, Austria and
Spain, but it is incredible either that Talleyrand should
neglect to press for so serious a guarantee of peace or
that Napoleon should allow him to do so. It was the
sight of Napoleon’s empire creeping out yearly beyond
the borders of France that lit the flame&mdash;first of suspicion,
finally of war. With this fatal ambition
Talleyrand had no sympathy.</p>

<p>We have already seen how, after the conclusion of
peace, Napoleon annexed Piedmont and Elba, and
virtually subjugated Switzerland. Talleyrand declares
that he made every effort to dissuade Napoleon from
incorporating Piedmont, and we have the evidence of
Luchesini that he threatened to resign if Napoleon
made himself President of the Swiss Republic. But
Piedmont was Napoleon’s own conquest, as well as the
base of operations in Italy. When England protested
against the invasion of Switzerland, and sent agents there
to intrigue against the French, he caused Talleyrand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
to write a despatch to the French envoy at London,
in which he unfolded the whole plan of a conquest of
Europe, and the closing of all its ports against England.
It is certain that Talleyrand averted the consequences of
this by modifying the message before it was actually
presented at London. Napoleon also complained bitterly
of the protection afforded to royalist conspirators and
libellists at London; and he said that, as Piedmont and
Switzerland were not mentioned in the Treaty of Amiens,
England had nothing to do with them.</p>

<p>In the early part of 1803 the strain became greater
and greater, and led quickly to rupture. The English
Ambassador at Paris, Lord Whitworth, was a firm and
dignified noble, with instructions to <i>be</i> firm and dignified
rather than accommodating. Napoleon had, in January,
published in the French papers a report on the mission
of General Sebastiani to Egypt, the tenor of which was
clearly to point to the practicability of a seizure by the
French. When, therefore, Talleyrand approached Lord
Whitworth on the subject of Malta at the close of the
month, he found that England was more determined
than ever to keep that island. Talleyrand made a
desperate effort to represent the mission as commercial,
but Napoleon now took up the matter, confessed that it
was <i>not</i> wholly commercial, and made his famous project
of an arrangement between England and France to
govern the world. He had received news of the miscarriage
of his West Indian expedition, and now seemed
to contemplate a brilliant venture in the East; but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
wanted peace until his plans were completed. As to
Piedmont and Switzerland, they were&mdash;he used a word
which Lord Whitworth shrinks from committing to
paper. George III replied by his appeal for the
embodiment of the militia and a further 10,000 men
for the Navy. A few days afterwards Napoleon, in his
most tactless manner, blurted out to Whitworth, as
he stood in the circle of ambassadors at the levee: “So
you want war?” He was now convinced that war
was inevitable, but he wanted to throw the burden of
declaring it on England.</p>

<p>Early in April Whitworth presented the English
terms. Malta must be retained by England, Holland
and Switzerland be evacuated by France and Elba ceded
to her, and the Italian and Ligurian Republics would be
recognized. When Talleyrand disclosed the terms
informally to Napoleon, he would listen to no compromise
that would nearly satisfy England. He prepared another
violent charge to be made upon Whitworth at the levee
on May 1st, but the English Ambassador was absent.
Napoleon returned to St. Cloud, and dictated minute
and characteristic instructions to Talleyrand for a last
interview with Whitworth. “Be cold, haughty, and
even rather proud in your bearing. If his note contains
the word ultimatum, point out to him that this word
includes ‘war,’ and that such a manner of negotiating is
rather that of a superior towards an inferior; if the
letter does not contain the word, force him to insert it....
Make him apprehensive as to the consequences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
of delivering such a note. If he is unshakable,
accompany him into your salon. When he is leaving
you, say: ‘Are the Cape and the Island of Gorée
evacuated!’ Tone down the close of the interview,
and invite him to see you again before writing home, so
that you can tell him what effect it has had on me.”</p>

<p>All the acting of the accomplished artists was of no
avail. The ultimatum had to be presented by Talleyrand,
and he was soundly abused by Napoleon for doing
so. It was submitted to the Council at St. Cloud on
May 11th, and all present except Talleyrand and Joseph
Bonaparte voted for the rejection of the British demands.
Lord Whitworth left Paris on the following day.
England declared war on France six days later. Thus
opened the Titanic struggle that was to bring Napoleon
to the dust after ten weary years, and after spreading
the flames of war from Moscow to Madrid. The
biographer of Talleyrand has only to point out that here
the Foreign Minister begins to diverge from the First
Consul. We shall find them again in closest co-operation,
until Napoleon’s harsh, arrogant and unworthy treatment
of Austria, Prussia, and Spain compels Talleyrand to
leave him; but the divergence begins in 1803, if not
at the end of 1802. Talleyrand disapproved of the
Gallicising of Piedmont and Switzerland, the mission of
Sebastiani, the irritating language of the French official
press and official documents, and the strict insistence on
the evacuation of Malta by the English. He faced and
endured the anger of Napoleon by his opposition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
Napoleon to some extent declined to use him in the
negotiations with England on account of his pacific
feeling; Whitworth is said to have avoided him somewhat
because of his “corruption.” But he stands out
clearly in this crisis as a friend of peace and humanity, a
wise and honest adviser, a firm opponent of Napoleon’s
growing and benighting ambition. Meantime, while
Napoleon is devising means to overleap the great barrier
of his plans, the English Channel, we have to follow
Talleyrand in the complicated negotiations with which
he fought England for the alliance or the neutrality of
the continental Powers.</p>

<p>Talleyrand was already in diplomatic correspondence
with Russia, Prussia and Austria, about the
“perfidy” of England in refusing to carry out the chief
enactment of the Treaty of Amiens&mdash;the evacuation of
Malta. The impressionable young Tsar was touched,
and complained of the obscurity of England’s aims.
Napoleon at once proposed that he should mediate
between the belligerents, and for some months he was
understood to be prepared to negotiate in this sense.
As a fact he was deeply engrossed in humanitarian
reform in his own country, and he had a growing
suspicion of Napoleon’s aims. After prolonged communications
he succeeded in drawing Prussia into a
defensive alliance (May 24th, 1805) against France.
This was a serious diplomatic defeat for Talleyrand, who
had at the same time been endeavouring to secure the
Prussian alliance. He had, in fact, concentrated his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
efforts to obtain at least a benevolent neutrality from
Berlin. “Do not be afraid of that mountain of snow,
Russia,” he wrote. Napoleon distributed honours at the
Prussian Court, and made generous offers of terms, but
the deeply perplexed and anxious successor of Frederic
the Great ended his long vacillation by concluding a
treaty with his friend, the Tsar.</p>

<p>It would be useless here to describe in any detail
the diplomatic work of the next two years (from the
declaration of war by England to the opening of the
campaign in 1805). Talleyrand’s task was to meet and
defeat the effort of Pitt to raise up a fresh coalition
against Napoleon. He made a loyal and brilliant effort
to do so, but entirely failed. Napoleon’s encroachments
were too obvious, his power in Europe too menacing,
his concessions in diplomacy too tardy and niggardly to
enable him to resist the power of English gold and the
zeal of the alienated Tsar. His only successes were of
an inglorious character. He forced helpless Spain to
acquiesce in the sale of Louisiana to the United States
for eighty millions, and to send seventy-two millions a
year to the French treasury. Napoleon assisted his
diplomacy in this case with two arguments: the formation
of a huge military camp near the Spanish frontier,
and a threat to draw the attention of Europe to the
delicate relations of the Spanish Queen and leading
minister.</p>

<p>In the course of the year 1804, Russia was
approached by England, and the Tsar showed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
willingness to enter into an alliance for the control of
Napoleon and in the interest of Europe. The mercantile
differences which had kept the two nations apart were
gradually adjusted, and a treaty was concluded in April,
1805. Gustavus IV of Sweden was already engaged to
Russia in the same sense. Austria, too, was bound by
a secret agreement with Russia (November 6th, 1804)
if Napoleon made any further aggression in Italy, or
threatened the integrity of Turkey. Thus by the
middle of 1805 a formidable coalition was in existence.
The correspondence of Talleyrand with Napoleon during
that period is an amazing indication of activity. He
keeps the Emperor informed of events in Turkey and
Sweden, Russia and England, Prussia and Austria; he
sends the news from the surgeons who are with the
armies and the secret agents who are plotting and
observing from Ireland to Persia; he tells the latest
marriages at Paris, the dissipations of the ambassadors,
the small scandals, so finely told, that will relieve
Napoleon’s leisure hours.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> There was no lack of spirit
or ability in his work, but Napoleon had cast for
war and it could at the most only be postponed.
When Talleyrand evaded the task of writing the
violent letters he directed to be sent to foreign
Courts, he wrote them himself. The Prussian
Ambassador informed his Court that Napoleon was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>forced into war in order to cover his enormous
accumulation of men at Boulogne for the ostensible
purpose of attacking England.</p>

<p>The spark that lit the conflagration was Napoleon’s
descent into Italy in May, 1805. Talleyrand accompanied
him to Milan. On May 26th he crowned
himself King of Italy with the famous iron crown of the
Lombard Kings, directed that a series of splendid
spectacles should impress upon the astounded nations this
last stroke of the effrontery of genius. The Ligurian
or Genoese Republic was at the same time declared
to be incorporated in the French Empire. Austria
was now bound by her agreement with Russia to
take action and she began to move her forces.
Talleyrand went back to Paris with Napoleon but
at the close of August we find he has joined the
Emperor at Boulogne. By this time all hope of
invading England was over. The combined French
and Spanish fleet had retreated to Cadiz. With a
phrase Napoleon converted the huge army, stretching
nine miles along the coast, into “the army of Germany,”
wheeled it about to face Austria, and set out for Paris to
make his final preparations.</p>

<p>Talleyrand followed Napoleon to Strassburg towards
the close of September. On the day that the Emperor
was to leave for the field Talleyrand dined with him,
and was greatly alarmed when Napoleon fell into a fit,
which lasted half an hour. He made the Foreign Minister
promise to keep it a secret, and was off in half an hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
to Carlsruhe.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> The letters he writes to Napoleon at
this time exhale the old perfume. “He is afflicted beyond
expression” to hear that he will learn nothing of
Napoleon for five or six days. In another letter he says:
“Your Majesty will always be deceived if you expect to
find in other kings the grandeur of soul, the loftiness of
sentiments, and the firmness of character that distinguish
you.” This is a little rank, but there are other indications
besides these letters that the old intimacy and
confidence had been restored. Talleyrand had bitterly
regretted the events at Milan, but, with his usual
acceptance of accomplished facts, he was hoping that the
defeat of Austria (of which he could entertain no doubt)
would relieve Napoleon’s ardour and pave the way for
peace. He wrote to d’Hauterive that the best thing
would be for Napoleon to give up the kingdom of Italy,
force Austria to abandon Venice, find her compensation
in Germany, and enter into an alliance with her. That
would remove grounds of quarrel in Italy. At the
same time he prepared a memorandum, and even a
treaty, to submit to Napoleon after the defeat of Austria.
Italy was to be given up, Switzerland declared neutral,
and the territory exacted of Austria to be divided among
the small German States that had joined France.</p>

<p>He sent this admirable memorandum to Napoleon
on the day he heard of the victory at Ulm. It had not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>sufficient of the arrogance of the conqueror in it for
Napoleon. He submitted it as the subject of a discussion
in Council, but the continued success of his arms
made him ambitious to dictate “better” terms. The
news of Trafalgar&mdash;Talleyrand broke it to him in his
happiest manner: “Genius and good fortune were in
Germany”&mdash;did not arrest him, or, indeed, forced him
to look yet more to continental expansion now that
his colonial scheme was shattered. He mistook
Talleyrand’s sagacity and good sense for a puling
humanitarianism. From Munich they passed on to
Vienna, where Talleyrand had to press Napoleon’s
harsh terms on Austria’s despairing statesmen. On
December 1st he again framed a sober and reasonable
treaty, but the next day occurred the battle of Austerlitz.
“The Emperor Alexander,” he says bitterly in his
memoirs, “was rather bored at Olmütz; he had never
witnessed a battle, and he wanted to see the fun.”
Talleyrand was exasperated against Russia and Austria
for not coming to terms earlier. The day after
Austerlitz he crossed the field with Marshal Lannes,
and saw even that hardened soldier turn away with a
feeling of sickness. He saw Napoleon established in
the house of an Austrian prince, and the proudest flags
and distinguished commanders of the two beaten nations
brought to his feet.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> He felt how difficult it would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>now to restrain the conqueror, though he made one
more eloquent appeal to him not to ruin Austria and
sow a harvest of hatred on the frontier of France.
Napoleon shook aside the appeal with a suspicion that
Talleyrand must have been bought.</p>

<p>From Austerlitz he went to Brünn, and there heard
with increased disgust that the Prussian Ambassador,
Haugwitz, had signed a treaty of alliance with Napoleon.
“Was it crime or folly?” Talleyrand asks. Prussia
had agreed with Russia to offer armed mediation to
Napoleon, and to make war on him if he did not accept
it by December 15th. Instead of this, Haugwitz was
bullied and bribed (by the offer of Hanover) into signing
an alliance. Talleyrand hurried on to Pressburg to
meet the Austrian envoys. Those who are tempted to
conceive him as indolent would do well to read his
letters at this time. At five in the morning of the 23rd
he writes to tell Napoleon that he was half-blinded in
crossing the frozen Danube, and so could not write
earlier (evidently there are no obscure assistants doing
the work for him here), but is now resuming work. At
two on the following morning he tells that he has had a
twelve hours’ conference with the Austrians, and will
begin again at eight. But Napoleon was inexorable.
The only modification of the terms that he would grant
was a reduction of the indemnity by ten million francs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>Austria had to part with Venice, Tyrol, Friuli, Istria,
and Dalmatia, and to recognise the kingdom of Italy.
That was Napoleon’s reply to Talleyrand’s memorandum.
He had begun to sow the dragon’s teeth. The
Austrian ministers were forced to sign the Treaty on
January 1st. The only service Talleyrand could render
them was to make the terms free from ambiguity. This
action was described by Napoleon as “infamous and
corrupt.” Talleyrand knew his master. Once before,
when someone was giving him instructions from
Napoleon as to the framing of the Cisalpine Constitution,
and was telling him to make it “short and clear,”
Talleyrand interrupted him with the words: “Yes,
short and obscure.”</p>

<p>Mr. Holland Rose fully admits the unwisdom of
Napoleon in rejecting Talleyrand’s plan of settlement,
but he thinks it rather due to the idea of a “continental
system” against England than to mere lust of domination.
The very scanty sea frontier of Austria made
her a matter of indifference in Napoleon’s plan of
excluding England from Europe; it was far more
important to win Prussia and Russia, and the Northern
States. No one will question that the dream of the
universal closing of ports was at work in the Treaty,
but it does not explain some of the worst features of
Napoleon’s divergence from Talleyrand. In any case,
it is unquestionable that, as Talleyrand says, “moderation
began to desert Napoleon after the Peace of
Amiens,” and each fresh victory&mdash;Ulm, Austerlitz,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
Jena, Friedland&mdash;increased his insensibility to the
sound law that a harsh and insolent settlement is not
final. This is the just and honourable ground of that
dissidence of feeling on the part of Talleyrand that
culminated in “desertion.”</p>

<p>In January they returned to Paris. Napoleon
arrived there at midnight of the 26th, and he opened a
financial council at eight the following morning. His
minister was scarcely less active. In the midst of his
distinctive labours he had found time to study the
financial disorder at home, and had submitted to
Napoleon a new plan of a bank. Now that they were in
Paris again the work of settlement had to be resumed.
Haugwitz arrived on February 1st with fresh proposals
from the King of Prussia, who had refused to ratify
his outrageous treaty of Schönbrunn until peace was
concluded with England. Napoleon’s whole policy being
directed against England, he took advantage of Prussia’s
delay to declare the treaty of Schönbrunn annulled, and
make Talleyrand draw up a fresh one which bound
Prussia to join the system by closing the Elbe and
Weser against England. The new treaty was ratified
at Berlin before the end of February. France had
ceded Hanover to Prussia as her reward, but Hanover
belonged to England. Moreover, a few weeks later
Napoleon made his brother Louis King of Holland, as
he had already made Joseph King of Naples. The
second chief ground of Talleyrand’s divergence from
Napoleon&mdash;the setting up of thrones for his family&mdash;was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
beginning to appear. “I don’t understand your way of
doing business at all,” said Napoleon angrily to him,
when he allowed the King of Prussia to state that the
occupation of Hanover had been forced on him. There
was “business” enough to do in the six months that
followed. Besides trouble with the Vatican and renewed
trouble with Austria, as well as the establishment of
Louis and Joseph in Holland and Naples, there were
important negotiations with England, Prussia, Russia
and the great work of forming the Rhine Confederation.</p>

<p>Fox had returned to office in England, and had
opened communications by sending information to Paris
of a plot (often thought to be a diplomatic one) against
the Emperor’s life. Talleyrand eagerly followed up the
opening, and expressed willingness to treat with England
by means of Lord Yarmouth, who had been detained as
a prisoner at Verdun. Yarmouth went to London with
an assurance that France was not hopelessly fixed as
regards Hanover, and returned full of hope on June
16th. But Napoleon’s vulpine diplomacy was again
overruling Talleyrand. He had forced him to promise
Prussia secretly that France would not sacrifice Hanover,
and to open separate negotiations with Russia. The
only difficulties that Napoleon recognised, Talleyrand
says, were those that force cannot overcome. His
minister had now to conduct a most complex and
mendacious communication with the three Powers, though
it might be pleaded in extenuation that the Powers were
also endeavouring to outwit each other. The policy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
England was comparatively straight&mdash;so straight, in fact,
that it was her minister who innocently betrayed
Napoleon’s duplicity. But while England refused to
negotiate a peace independently of Russia, that Power
was endeavouring to make a separate treaty with France,
and deceiving England as to her unfriendly designs on
Turkey; while she was at the same time concluding a
secret agreement against France with Prussia. The
latter Power, secretly signing the treaty against France
on July 1st with Russia, was receiving from Napoleon
the reassurance of Hanover (already promised by France
to England) and entertaining proposals from him for her
aggrandisement in Germany. France was simultaneously
offering Hanover to England and Prussia, was secretly
creating a great German confederation and denying to
England and Prussia that she contemplated any changes
in Germany, was playing with England until she could
secure the separate alliance with Russia, and was secretly
raising opposition to the latter Power in Turkey. And
amidst this maze of negotiations and intrigue Talleyrand
was coolly creating the Rhine Confederation and dealing
with the huge crowd of German delegates who besieged
the Hotel Galiffet with further demands for plunder
or redress.</p>

<p>This network of intrigue broke by its own weight,
and the sword of Napoleon did the rest before the close
of the year. A Russian envoy arrived at Paris about
the very date when the Tsar was concluding his secret
alliance with Prussia against Napoleon. As in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
earlier episode with Austria, the envoy was worried into
going far beyond his powers and signing a treaty with
France. He afterwards declared that Talleyrand terrified
him with a threat that, unless he signed, Austria would
again be attacked and annihilated. As soon as the
Russian envoy had gone Talleyrand turned to Lord
Yarmouth, and threatened that Portugal would be
invaded unless England came to terms. Yarmouth in
the meantime had betrayed to the Prussian Ambassador
the French offer to give up Hanover, and Napoleon
intercepted dispatches in which the Ambassador urged
his Court to appeal to Russia. Moreover, Talleyrand
had denied to Yarmouth that any changes were contemplated
in Germany, although he must have already
completed the scheme of the Rhine Confederation, and
it was published a few days afterwards. England thereupon
sent Lord Lauderdale to support, and eventually
supersede, Yarmouth. Talleyrand says this was done
“to please Lord Grenville,” but his dislike of
Lauderdale is clearly due to the fact that he now had
stiffer material to deal with. In August he wrote
to Napoleon: “The claims of Lord Lauderdale over
his slain sailor, and the fuss he makes of the affair,
are the acts of a man who has been all his life a
clubman and parliamentary declaimer, and does not
know that an incident that may make a great
scene between two parties is generally one that
vanishes before more precise information and moderate
explanations.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span></p>

<p>Talleyrand was as ardent as ever for peace with
England. Napoleon leaned just as strongly to his
continental system against England. The march of
events frustrated Talleyrand’s pacific aim once more.
On the strength of his treaty with Russia, Napoleon
made Talleyrand present exorbitant terms to Lauderdale,
who demanded his passports. “Delay him a little,” said
Napoleon; “tell him I am hunting and will be back
soon.” He was hoping to hear of the ratification of the
Russian treaty. He heard instead that the Tsar refused
to sign it, and had appointed a Gallophobe minister.
He still, however, refused to meet England by withdrawing
his demand for Sicily, and in a week or two
the whole intrigue came to a close in war with Prussia.</p>

<p>The betrayal of Napoleon’s duplicity in regard to
Hanover had caused a very natural and dangerous
agitation in Prussia. This was more than doubled
when the Act of the Confederation of the Rhine was
signed and published in July. The new kings created
by Napoleon in 1805 (Wurtemburg, Baden, and
Bavaria), in the partition of the ecclesiastical territory
on the Rhine, had attempted to exercise the full feudal
rights of the old Empire. The smaller princes, free
towns, and “immediate” nobles appealed against them
to France, and a fresh settlement was necessary. In
co-operation with Bishop Dalberg, Talleyrand (who had
now a new ex-clerical assistant, La Besnardière) began
the work of settling disputes and drafting the chief of
the smaller states into a Rhein-Bund, to be controlled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
by Napoleon. Only the representatives of Wurtemberg,
Baden, and Bavaria were to be admitted to a share in
the secret construction, but the rumour of it brought a
flock of Teutonic envoys to beset the Hotel Galiffet,
while Prussian, English, and Austrian spies hovered
restlessly about. The Act was completed by the middle
of July, and all the south German princelings were
admitted to sign it. It is usual to point out here that
Talleyrand once more reaped a rich harvest for his
work. No one would question that he, as usual,
accepted presents from the States that benefitted by
admission. But here again charges have been endorsed
without the least discrimination. Count von Senfft, who
is more or less friendly to Talleyrand, should be the
safest witness to rely upon. Senfft, however, tells us
that Talleyrand made use of Von Gagern “in his
financial relations with the German princes”; whereas
Von Gagern, while confessing a belief that Talleyrand
did make a lot of money somehow, gives us his solemn
and credible assurance that not a farthing passed between
them in connection with the Rhine Confederation.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>
There can be no doubt that Talleyrand’s profit has been
grossly exaggerated. On the political side it is not
questioned that the new creation was a great advantage
to France, however selfish her motive may have been;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>it raised a bulwark against Prussia and Russia, and
provided a fresh army to Napoleon of 63,000 men. Nor
is it questioned that the unification and the adoption of
the Napoleonic Code brought great advantages to the
States involved.</p>

<p>The work of the year seems to have increased
Napoleon’s appreciation of Talleyrand in spite of
occasional suspicion and annoyance. In June he
bestowed on his foreign minister the papal fief of
Benevento, with the title of Prince. He had appropriated
Benevento and Ponte Corvo on the ground
that they led to incessant friction between Rome and
Naples. Talleyrand merely claims that his rule in
Benevento sheltered that little principality “from all
spoliation and from conscription.” His biographers
have not done him justice in the matter. Not only
did Talleyrand abstain from making profit out of his
gift, but he at once dispatched to Italy a humane and
enlightened governor, and had a policy carried out in
the sleepy and retrograde province that was of immense
service to it.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> On his side Talleyrand seems to have
retained for some time the feeling of disappointment
produced by Napoleon’s treatment of Austria. There
is a distinct coolness in his letters throughout the spring
and summer. But Napoleon overcame his repugnance,
and they set out together for the Prussian campaign
in apparent cordiality. At all events it is recorded that
Napoleon wept on leaving Talleyrand at Mayence.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span></p>
<p>If Prussia had joined with the Austrians and
Russians before Austerlitz, Napoleon’s position would
have been very serious. He contrived to keep
Haugwitz on the move until after that battle, and then
persuaded him to sign an alliance. By the time Prussia
learned how much she was really despised at Paris&mdash;a
contempt in which Talleyrand now entirely joined
with D’Hauterive&mdash;Austria was powerless, Russia had
demobilised, and England was so far alienated that her
offer of assistance only arrived after Jena. But when
the news of the secret creation of the Rhine Confederation
came on top of the exasperation over Hanover,
the national temper was raised to white heat, and the
King flung out a single-handed challenge to Napoleon.
It was not without anxiety that Napoleon confronted
the Prussian forces for the first time; and Talleyrand
expresses real concern in his letters from Mayence,
where he is staying with the Empress and the Queen
of Holland. “Three days without news of you,” he
writes, “are three centuries of anxiety and pain.” He
warns Napoleon that there is a plot to assassinate him
amongst the Prussian officers. At last (October 14th)
comes the report of Jena. Within one month of their
leaving Paris he is in Berlin with Napoleon, and sees
the Emperor proudly dictating notes to his army in the
cabinet of Frederick the Great.</p>

<p>Talleyrand remained at Berlin until the end of
November, but Napoleon, who was bent on crushing
Prussia as he had crushed Austria, began to dispense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
with the services of his moderate councillor. Talleyrand
had nothing to do with the insulting bulletins
issued from the Prussian capital, or the Berlin Decree
against England. Indeed, he affirms that in view of
Napoleon’s attitude towards Prussia and Spain (which
had just shown a not obscure sign of revolt) he resolved
to resign his position as soon as they returned to
France. He did this, as a matter of fact, but he had
much to see and to do before reaching Paris once more.
Napoleon brushed aside the Prussian negotiators at
Berlin, and marched on to Posen to deal with Russia.
Talleyrand joined him there, found him harangueing a
deputation of Poles (got up by Murat) on national
greatness, and telling them they will be a nation when
they furnish him with an army of 40,000 men. Talleyrand
also says that he found Napoleon reading a list of
pictures to be taken to Paris from the Dresden galleries,
and succeeded in preventing the raid. They moved on
to Warsaw, where Napoleon left him to go and “shove
these new Europeans [the Russians] back into their
former limits.” He made a bad beginning at Pultusk,
but returned to Warsaw as bombastic as ever, and spent
several weeks in infusing military ardour into Poland
and extracting an army from it. Talleyrand profited by
the Emperor’s temporary check to save the lives of a
few small places (Anhalt, Lippé, Waldeck, Reuss, and
Schwartzburg) by including them in the Rhine Confederation.
Napoleon wanted them for Murat, and did
not thank his Foreign Minister for again thwarting him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span></p>

<p>But the service rendered by Talleyrand to
Napoleon during that winter in Poland was considerable.
Napoleon did not at first set a stirring example.
He fell into a period of sensuality, and, says Talleyrand,
“laid his glory publicly enough at the feet of a beautiful
Pole.” The Countess Anastase Walewska, then only
seventeen years old, aspired to influence the Emperor
in the interest of her country, and only succeeded in
making the winter pass pleasantly for him at the castle
of Finkenstein. Von Gagern, who met her and her
son afterwards at Paris, was at Warsaw, and says that
Talleyrand told him one day he was unwilling any longer
to be “an instrument in the hand of the destroying
angel of Europe.” He was at that time acting, not only
as diplomatic minister in the continuous correspondence
with Austria and Prussia, but as chief military agent.
Napoleon had appointed an incompetent governor at
Warsaw, and had enjoined Talleyrand to see to the
commissariat and transport of the army. “To-day,”
the Emperor writes on March 12th, “the fate of
Europe and the greatest calculations depend on supplies.
It will be child’s play to beat the Russians if I have
food. Whatever you do will be done well. The
charge I entrust to you is more important than all the
negotiations in the world.” The hundred letters that
Talleyrand writes to him during those four months&mdash;letters
clearly written with his own hand&mdash;reflect an
amazing activity. He is seeing, amid tremendous
difficulties, that the Emperor gets 50,000 rations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
biscuits and 2,000 pints of brandy, and so on, every
day: he has had to settle a strike of the transport
servants and the bakers: he has been round the military
hospitals, distributing gifts from the Emperor,
and “listening to the little requests” of the wounded
soldiers; he sends the latest information about the state
of the roads and the finances, the movements of the
enemy, the dissipations of the Court at Warsaw, the
important and interesting passages in the French and
English journals, the progress of negotiations with
Austria, Turkey, Prussia, &amp;c. His carriage is fired at
by guerillas as he travels, or sticks in the mud for hours
together. He has at times to put up with the most
wretched accommodation.</p>

<p>But Baron von Gagern makes a superfluous conjecture
when he fancies the laborious stay in Poland
had any influence on Talleyrand’s attitude towards
Napoleon. There are more obvious grounds for the
divergence. On the whole, Talleyrand’s feeling at this
time was much the same as before Ulm and Austerlitz.
He was waiting to see what use would be made of the
new successes. He sends cordial messages to the
Emperor, and performs his heavy duties loyally and
well, with an occasional furtive departure for some
humane motive. One day he comes to tell Von
Gagern that a young Prussian count is in the Russian
camp, and must be got away at once or Napoleon will
hear and inflict heavy punishment. Von Gagern learns
through Austria that the Count is seriously ill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
“That is a mere empty phrase to the Emperor,” says
Talleyrand, and insists on his removal. He was transferred
without the matter coming to Napoleon’s ears,
and his house was saved. Von Gagern adds that
Talleyrand refused to take a single florin for the
service he had rendered.</p>

<p>On the other hand he refused and returned four
million florins that were put in the hands of his confidant,
Baron Dalberg, by the Poles. Talleyrand
rather despised the Poles as an incompetent and quarrelsome
people. He resisted all efforts to induce him
to take up their cause. The caresses of Princess
Poniatowski and Countess Tyszkiewicz had no more
effect than the offer of money, though they modified
his dislike of Poland, and made him say in the end
that he “quitted it with regret.”</p>

<p>At last the Russian winter dissolved and Napoleon
moved his forces. On February 8th came the news of
Eylau, “a battle more or less won,” Talleyrand says.
Von Gagern found him in good spirits because he was
empowered to offer moderate terms to Prussia, but the
negotiations fell through, and he had to wait for the
decisive overthrow of Russia. It was about this time
that Napoleon once fell asleep in the room with him, and
Talleyrand remained in his chair the whole night so as
not to awake him. Then came Friedland (June 14th),
and Talleyrand, who had left Warsaw in May, made a
stirring appeal to the Emperor for peace. He trusts it is
his “last victory” and a “guarantee of peace.” But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
disappointment of the preceding year was to be repeated,
and he was to see Napoleon’s soaring ambition take a
flight that he could not follow. The Tsar, though
he knew Austria was preparing for action and Tartar
reinforcements were on the way, arranged an armistice
with Napoleon, and Prussia had to do the same. The
proceedings that followed when the two Emperors met
at Tilsit completed Talleyrand’s repugnance to
Napoleon’s policy. Victory was once more made the
step to a further war. The whole of Europe was now
to be enlisted against England in the long dreamed of
“continental system.” Alexander was exasperated against
England for her failure to support him, and listened
eagerly to the new idea of sharing the world between
France and Russia (Napoleon’s “new Europeans” of
nine months ago). Whether or no it is true that
Alexander’s first words to Napoleon, as he stepped on
to the raft in the middle of the Niemen (which fitted so
well in “the poem of his life,” says Talleyrand), were:
“I hate the English as much as you do, and I will second
you in all your projects against them,”<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> the whole
arrangement concluded was directed against England.
Prussia and Russia were forced into the continental
system. Prussia was humbled to the dust, and reduced
from nine to four million inhabitants. Talleyrand says
Alexander thought he had “done all that friendship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>required for the King of Prussia in nominally preserving
half his kingdom.” He saw the Tsar’s eyes sparkle
when Napoleon, on receiving news of the deposition of
the Sultan, spoke to him, “with an air of submitting to
the decrees of Providence,” of an inevitable dismemberment
of Turkey. But Napoleon told Talleyrand privately
that not a word must be said in the treaty about Turkey,
or about Moldavia and Wallachia, which also he had
dangled before the eyes of the Tsar.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="caption">ALEXANDER I., EMPEROR OF RUSSIA.</p></div>



<p>Talleyrand was disgusted at Napoleon’s brutal
treatment of Prussia. He had several tender interviews
with the Prussian Queen, and she spoke to him with
great feeling at her departure. He had also several
private interviews with Alexander, and, although he
greatly disliked that monarch’s betrayal of Prussia, he
won an influence over him which was to have historic
importance. At the time it is possible, perhaps, to trace
Talleyrand’s moderating influence in one or two details
of the Treaty. He had, however, rigid instructions from
Napoleon, and he had to sign the treaty with Prussia
without having had any share in making it. There is a
story of his betraying the secret articles to England.
It rests on no authority, and Mr. Holland Rose has
shown in his “Napoleonic Studies” that it is completely
untenable.</p>

<p>He returned to Paris in August, and immediately
resigned the foreign ministry. The separation was made
in apparent amity. In a letter of August 10th (1807)
Talleyrand tells the Emperor he is performing his last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
act as foreign minister, but “the first and last sentiment
of my life will be gratitude and devotion.” Napoleon
was no less polite. He created a rich sinecure, the
Vice-grand Electorship, for Talleyrand. He dropped
his pilot with grace and forged ahead&mdash;towards the
rocks. When Paris heard of Talleyrand’s new appointment,
it said: “Another vice for him.”</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span></p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">AWAY FROM NAPOLEON</span></p>


<p>The legendary version of Talleyrand’s character that
still lingers amongst encyclopædists and historians is
refuted by his resignation in 1807. No cause can be
assigned for it except an honest refusal to co-operate
further with Napoleon’s harsh and dangerous and selfish
policy. “Napoleon has abandoned the cause of peoples
and is bent only on personal glory. He has entered on
the fatal path of nepotism, in which I shall decline to
follow him.” Talleyrand said this in 1807, not as a
later explanation of his step. To Mme. de Rémusat
he also said, in the same year: “Napoleon suspects me
whenever I speak of moderation; if he ceases to believe
me you will see with what folly he will compromise
himself and us.” We are offered no serious alternative
as a motive of Talleyrand’s retirement, which Count von
Senfft describes as “very honorable.” The Emperor,
says Senfft, wanted “absolutely submissive instruments.”
Talleyrand declined to be one, as soon as the tragic
selfishness of Napoleon was fully revealed. No one
affected not to understand his action. It was a protest&mdash;a
protest made at the height of Napoleon’s power. He
had worked loyally and well with the Emperor “to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
establish for France monarchical institutions which should
guarantee the authority of the sovereign by restricting it
within just limits; and to induce Europe not to grudge
France her prosperity and glory.” Now Napoleon’s
ambition was naked, France was burdened with the most
exacting and ruinous military servitude to it, humanity
was trodden under foot. And the only man in France
to refuse further service was the man who is glibly
described as devoid of principle or ideal, and prepared
at all times to sell his soul to the wealthiest master.</p>

<p>So little obligation is felt to historical facts by those
early and malicious biographers of Talleyrand, on whom
our historians seem to rely, that Michaud says he is
“quite sure” Talleyrand remained even after Tilsit
the inspirer of Napoleon’s plans of conquest. Michaud
is thinking in the first place of Napoleon’s descent on
Spain, and it must be admitted that it requires careful
study to determine Talleyrand’s attitude on this subject.
Just before Jena, the Spanish minister, Godoy, had
commenced operations for war against some unnamed
Power, which all knew to be France, and Napoleon
had sworn to Talleyrand that he would extinguish the
Spanish Bourbons. When the news of Napoleon’s
success reached Madrid, Godoy endeavoured to undo
his terrible blunder, and Napoleon concealed for a time
the claw that was in readiness for Spain. They returned
to Paris in August, and Napoleon shortly turned his
attention to the Peninsula. Portugal had refused to
join in the blockade against England. A treaty was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
signed by Spain and France, dividing it (in very
unequal fractions) between them, and the French troops
crossed the Pyrenees.</p>

<p>I need only summarise here the rapid and disgraceful
succession of events in Spain. After Portugal
had been taken, the French troops remained masters
of Spain. In March the Spanish people, threatened
with national ruin and disgusted with their incompetent
and scandalous rulers, effected a Revolution. Charles IV
abdicated, and was replaced by Ferdinand. Napoleon
arrived at Bayonne, enticed both Ferdinand and the
late Royal Family there by a trick, and forced them
to abdicate. He wrote to Talleyrand on May 1st:
“King Charles is a frank and good-looking fellow. The
Queen’s sentimentality and history are written on her
face&mdash;that will tell you enough. Godoy looks like a
bull.... He had better be relieved of any imputation
of lying, but must be left covered with a thin veil of
contempt. Ferdinand is a brute, very malicious, and
very hostile to France.” A few days later he wrote
again to say that Talleyrand must receive and guard
the Spanish princes at the mansion he had just bought
at Valençay. “Your mission is an honourable one,”
he says, sarcastically. “To receive and entertain three
illustrious personages is quite in keeping with the
character of the nation and with your rank.”</p>

<p>Talleyrand affirms in the memoirs that he had
entirely disapproved the Spanish expedition, and that
Napoleon sent the princes to him in order to make it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
appear that he approved. His enemies and Napoleon
declare that he fully endorsed and urged the expedition
until its evil effects were clear, and then disowned it.
We have here another of the “mysteries” of Talleyrand’s
career. The subject had arisen while he was
with the Emperor in Germany and Poland, and,
although he had resigned the Foreign Ministry on
their return, it must not be supposed that he ceased
entirely to share the conduct of foreign affairs. Senfft
says that his successor in the Ministry, Champagny,
so bored and annoyed Napoleon by the contrast of his
incompetence, that Talleyrand was practically recalled
to office in October. The truth seems to be that his
Chancellorship, which gave him a certain formal interest
in foreign affairs, was interpreted with some elasticity.
For a time Talleyrand did not resist this. We shall
find him doing important work presently. He had
made his protest sufficiently clear.</p>

<p>However, in the matter of the Spanish expedition
it seems possible to show that Talleyrand had little or
no influence. Did he, or did he not, approve the expedition,
apart from the treacherous termination? In his
memoirs he says that he violently opposed this “insensate”
invasion, and that “the disgrace which my candour
brought on me justifies me in my conscience for separating
myself from his policy and finally from his person.”
This was written, of course, after all the world saw
the blunder. Thiers concludes that he recovered
Napoleon’s favour after Tilsit by complaisance in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
Spanish plans. He relies on Cambacérès, who is
habitually hostile to Talleyrand. Pasquier, another
hostile writer, says that Talleyrand urged Napoleon to
make war on Spain, and appropriate the crown.
D’Hauterive is described by his biographer as saying
that Talleyrand was “in favour of the expedition <i>on
certain conditions</i>.” Napoleon declared to Las Cases
that Talleyrand “goaded him into war.” Mme. de
Rémusat, generally credible, says Talleyrand “was in
favour of an open declaration of war” to overthrow
the dynasty in the interest of Spain. Lytton quotes
Beugnot for his belief that Talleyrand opposed the
expedition altogether; and Count Ségur quotes de Pradt
virtually to the same effect.</p>

<p>We have the usual conflict of evidence. We must
at once distrust Napoleon’s later statements. The ex-Emperor
would not take the trouble to “lie beautifully.”
He forfeits all claim to be heard here when he goes on
to say that Talleyrand urged him to murder the Spanish
princes! I am just as ready to surrender Talleyrand’s
statement that he “vehemently opposed” the expedition.
In fact he also says: “Driven to death by the
specious arguments of the Emperor, I advised him to
occupy Catalonia until he should be able to conclude a
maritime peace with England.” If we moderate the first
few words, we probably have here the truth of the
matter; though it is very possible that the sight of
the incompetence of the royal family and the distress
of Spain kept his mind in some vacillation as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
the intervention of France. That he urged Napoleon
to invade and annex Spain is a statement made by
the Emperor’s admirers only after it had proved
a fatal and dishonourable enterprise; that the Emperor
needed any such urging on the part of Talleyrand is a
perfectly ludicrous supposition. The most probable
reading of the situation (as regards Spain) <i>before</i> the
troops cross the Pyrenees is that Talleyrand wavered
between two motives&mdash;a keen perception of Spain’s evil
plight on the one hand and of Napoleon’s ambition and
nepotism on the other&mdash;and used vaguely approving
language.</p>

<p>The final action of Napoleon was determined by
the course of events, and not submitted for his approval
or disapproval. There is no ambiguity about Talleyrand’s
attitude on that. He was at his new home at
Valençay in Touraine, a large and beautiful chateau
lying in an extensive park, when the Spanish royal
carriage arrived. In its heavy medieval splendour, with
its panels of gold and silver, its curtains of crimson silk,
and its huge gilt wheels, it reminded him painfully of
the arrested development of Spain. He received the
two young princes and their uncle with some feeling,
and then set out for Nantes to meet Napoleon. If we
may trust the memoirs (I would not press the point),
he told Napoleon very freely what he thought of his
stratagem. “It is one thing to take crowns, another thing
to steal them,” he claims to have said; and it is stated
that he told the Emperor that many irregularities, such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
as mistresses, would be overlooked in a gentleman, but
when he stooped to cheating at cards he forfeited the
name. Napoleon went on to Paris, and Talleyrand
returned to Valençay. The Emperor paid him 75,000
francs a year for the maintenance of the princes, but he
seems to have treated them with real sympathy.</p>

<p>The task of entertaining them proved difficult.
They had not a single accomplishment that counted in
the code of a French gentleman. The attempt to
interest them in books was a complete failure. Talleyrand
did, indeed, notice with some consolation, that
the pious uncle, Don Antonio, spent long hours in his
valuable library, but he was more than disappointed
when he discovered that the devout Spaniard had been
cutting out the illustrations from rare old editions of
the bible and the classics, to protect the morals of his
nephews. It is usually said, and was certainly generally
believed at Paris, that Don Carlos repaid his host by
becoming the lover of Princess Talleyrand. “Spain
was unlucky for both of us,” said Napoleon to him
when he heard this. But the anonymous biographer of
the princess<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> points out that even Mme. de Rémusat
(who detested the princess) does not expressly accuse
them of more than a platonic affection, and claims that
not a single stain rests on her character after she became
Mme. Talleyrand. In any case, Talleyrand insisted that
they should be treated as princes. Napoleon wrote to
complain that Ferdinand was addressing him as “mon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>cousin,” and directed that he be taught to write “Sire.”
“Ajaccio and St. Helena dispense with comment,” says
Talleyrand. When Colonel Henri, commanding the
military guard, made himself officious, he told him that
the Emperor did not rule at Valençay. But in the
midst of his efforts to teach them to shoot and ride and
read he was summoned to Paris. The princes parted
from him with tears, and offered him their old prayer-books
as souvenirs.</p>

<p>Napoleon had in February suggested a second
conference with the Tsar. At that time he was offering
Russia Constantinople and impelling it to a descent on
India, was sending an army against Sweden, and was
menacing the very existence of Prussia and Austria.
He had a real idea of dividing the Old World with
Russia, and excluding England from it. Then came
news of the rising of the people of Spain against France,
and the landing of the English in Portugal. Wellesley
had begun his historic advance towards Paris; though
few then dreamed of the end of it. The southern trouble
upset Napoleon’s calculations and diverted troops from
the north. He fixed September 27th (1808) for the
meeting with Alexander, and sent for Talleyrand to
accompany him. He was weary of Champagny “coming
every morning to excuse his blunders of the previous
day,” Talleyrand says. At all events, Talleyrand’s
experience at Tilsit and his friendship with Alexander
recommended him. Napoleon directed all the documents
to be sent to him, and met him with the most engaging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
confidence and cordiality. He would remember later
that Talleyrand was already talking to members of his
Court of his “vile treachery” in Spain. Talleyrand
studied the correspondence, and “at once made up his
mind to prevent the spirit of enterprise from dominating
this singular interview.” In the circumstances we can
hardly hold that his acceptance was an infringement of
the dignity of his resignation. In any case, his position
as Grand Chamberlain compelled him to go.</p>

<p>So in September Talleyrand found himself on the
way to Erfurt with the vast apparatus that Napoleon had
dispatched to impress his allies. The road from Paris
was alive with couriers, carriages, officers and troops.
Napoleon had ordered the whole of the Comédie
Française to go. When Dazincourt asked if they were
to play comedies or tragedies, he replied that comedy
was not appreciated beyond the Rhine. Dazincourt
suggested “Athalie” amongst other tragedies. “What
do you mean?” he said. “Do you think I want to get
Joas into the heads of these Germans?” “These
Germans,” he said to Talleyrand, “are still talking of
d’Enghien. We must raise (agrandir) their standard of
morality. I am not thinking of Alexander. Such things
are nothing to a Russian. But we have to stir the men
with melancholic ideas who abound in Germany.” He
meant thinkers like Goethe. They must “give tragedies
like Cinna,” and he sang the couplet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Tous ces crimes d’État qu’on fait pour la couronne</div>
<div class="line">Le ciel nous en absout alors qu’il nous la donne.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span></p>

<p>The first actors and actresses and the first soldiers in
Europe jostled each other on the route. Nothing was forgotten.
One dignitary was included “to do the honours
of our actresses for the Grand Duke Constantine.”</p>

<p>In giving Talleyrand instructions he said that he
wanted a treaty which would pledge him to nothing in
the Levant (the chief magnet with which he was drawing
Alexander), secure the passivity of Austria, and leave him
free to do what he liked in Spain and to attack England.
Talleyrand drew one up in two days, which was fairly
satisfactory, though not strong enough as regards
Austria. His last direction to Talleyrand was to see
Alexander often in private and feed his facile imagination
with dreams. “There’s a fine field for your philanthropic
faculty! I give you carte blanche in it&mdash;only let it be
a sufficiently remote philosophy. Adieu!” There was
just one point that the great impresario overlooked, or
failed to appreciate enough&mdash;the change in Talleyrand’s
disposition. His Grand Chamberlain was now seriously
determined to thwart him and save Austria. “If he
had succeeded at Erfurt,” Talleyrand says, “he would
have picked a quarrel with Austria and dealt with it as
he had done with Prussia.” In the end he signed a
totally different treaty from what he had intended, and
the Tsar wrote a private letter to reassure the Emperor
of Austria. Talleyrand claims, not incongruously, that
he acted in Napoleon’s true interest.</p>

<p>To understand this result we have to examine the
double current of life at Erfurt. While Alexander was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
exposed to the full force of Napoleon’s ingenious action
every day, he was seeing Talleyrand privately every night
and being put on his guard. Napoleon arrived on the
morning of the 27th with some of his most brilliant
regiments, the crowds having lined his route all night.
By the time Alexander arrived, two days later, there
were forty monarchs and dukes in Erfurt with their
Courts. Napoleon told Talleyrand he was delighted
with his first conversation with Alexander, but no
business must be touched until the Tsar is thoroughly
“dazed” with French magnificence. He had altered
Talleyrand’s treaty, making the terms more onerous for
Austria. That night Talleyrand went to take tea with
the Princess de la Tour et Taxis. Alexander followed
in a quarter of an hour, and it was arranged that they
should meet there every night after the opera. Talleyrand
was also intimate with the Austrian ambassador,
Baron Vincent, who was admitted at times to the
nocturnal tea-party.</p>

<p>Thus the play proceeded. Napoleon artfully
arranged long déjeuners, to be followed by hunts,
reviews, or excursions that would last until dinner,
and opera to close the day’s work. There was no
time to talk business. Every opera was selected by
Napoleon. He foresaw the applause when, in “Mahomet,”
the line occurred:</p>

<p>“Qui l’a fait roi? Qui l’a couronné? La victoire.”
The Grand Chamberlain saw Napoleon home every
night (or early morning), and went at once to the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
of the discreet princess. After a few days Napoleon
said to Alexander that they must speak of the treaty,
and suggested that it should be kept to themselves.
That night, when Alexander came to the princess’s, he
bade her guard the door, and pulled the treaty from
his pocket. Talleyrand implored him not to be drawn
into any engagement to the detriment of Austria.
Napoleon complained to Talleyrand that he could “get
nothing out of Alexander.” He must leave Austria
alone, and trust to scare it with the secret articles of
the treaty. Talleyrand did not conceal his interest in
Austria, but was told to continue to see Alexander, as
Napoleon wanted to part on good terms. He did
continue, with more effect than Napoleon imagined.
When asked afterwards if he had not been imprudent,
he replied: “I have never been betrayed by a woman.”
From the first day he had said to Alexander: “It is
for you to save Europe by making a stand against
Napoleon. The French nation is civilised, but its ruler
is not; the sovereign of Russia is civilised, but his
people are not. The Russian monarch must unite with
the French people.”</p>

<p>It is idle casuistry to prove that this was not
treachery to Napoleon. It was done in pursuit of a
deliberate plan to thwart him in the interest of France.
There was now in the mind of Talleyrand a broad
and clear distinction between the needs of France and
the ambition of its Emperor, or, if you will, Napoleon’s
view of its needs. Talleyrand’s view is admitted to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
been more statesmanlike. The only question is whether
Talleyrand was justified in accepting service under the
Emperor with the determination to be disloyal to his
personal views for the good of the country, if not in
his own real interest. However that question may
be answered, we must not ignore the bearing of these
episodes on the chief charge against Talleyrand’s
character. Lord Brougham, in his otherwise admirable
sketch, says that we cannot altogether admire a man who
was “always on the side of success.” But here we have
Talleyrand wielding an opposition to Napoleon that
would almost have cost him his life if it had become
known, at the very summit of the Emperor’s power,
and in a purely patriotic and humane interest. The
legendary Talleyrand would not have dared to do it&mdash;could
not have conceived it. Napoleon never discovered
precisely what passed in the princess’s house, but he
knew Talleyrand was meeting Alexander there, and that
Talleyrand was a convinced pro-Austrian.</p>

<p>The Tsar obtained the provinces he wanted on
the Danube without being pledged to more than an
attack on Austria if she joined with England against
France. In one other important matter Talleyrand
more or less deceived Napoleon. The Emperor
detained him one night with a pathetic reference to his
childlessness, and at last “dropped the word divorce.”
He would like to marry one of Alexander’s sisters,
and Talleyrand might, “as a Frenchman,” suggest the
idea to the Tsar. Towards two o’clock he went to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
usual rendezvous, and found the Tsar telling the
Princess with some feeling how Napoleon had that
morning referred to his want of an heir. It had been
“wrung from him.” Talleyrand not only knew the
alliance was impossible from the Russian point of view,
but considered it inadvisable for the country. He told
the Tsar of Napoleon’s wish, and they agreed to humour
him for the time by suggesting Anna, who was only
fourteen years old.</p>

<p>The long series of fêtes and spectacles wore on
meantime. One day Napoleon sent his actors to
Weimar, and, after a hunt on the very field of Jena,
entertained the princes to a banquet. The opera that
night was unhappily chosen, “La mort de César,” but
a ball was added that “dissipated the impression.”
Napoleon made an effort to dazzle Goethe and Wieland
with the brilliancy of his culture. Goethe made quiet
and neat replies to the Emperor’s forced and well-prepared
sallies into literature. Talleyrand has
preserved an account of the conversation, but omitted
one of its best passages. When Napoleon said he did
not like the end of “Werther,” Goethe replied: “I
did not know that your Majesty liked romances to
have an end.” Wieland took up the defence of
Tacitus against Napoleon. “I agree,” he said, “that
his chief aim is to punish tyrants; but he denounces
them to the justice of the ages and of the human race.”
When, on the day before his departure, the crowd of
princes and nobles gathered about Napoleon&mdash;“I did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
not see a single hand pass with any dignity over the
lion’s mane,” says Talleyrand&mdash;he turned again to the
literary men, and asked if they had any idealists in
Germany. They had many. “I pity you,” he replied.
“These philosophers torture themselves with the
creation of systems. They will search in vain for a
better one than Christianity, which reconciles man with
himself, and at the same time assures public order and
the tranquility of States.” The feelings of the
“idealists” are not recorded. Talleyrand himself
disappoints us. He had Goethe to dinner one evening,
and does not reproduce a word of the conversation, or
devote a single line to appreciation of the greatest man
in that historic gathering.</p>

<p>When they returned from Paris Napoleon set out
for Spain, and Talleyrand settled down to a life of
comparative quiet. After leaving the Hotel Galiffet he
had occupied a small house at the corner of the rue
d’Anjou, but he now bought the large Hotel de Monaco
in the rue de Varennes. His old friends, Narbonne and
Choiseul, had returned to Paris and helped to restore in
his magnificent salon the gaiety and wit of the earlier
days. Other groups of the old nobility were forming,
and no figure was more welcome amongst them than that
of the ex-bishop. At the Duchess de Laval’s he met once
more the Duchess de Luynes, the Duchess de Fitzjames,
the Countess Jaucourt, Mme. de Bauffremont, and many
another great lady of the past and great admirer of himself.
The Countess Tyszkiewicz, who had “caught the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
complaint of falling in love with Talleyrand” at Warsaw,
brought a strong accession of fervour to the cult. The
old society of Paris was forming the nucleus of the new,
and, with a dim consciousness of their work, preparing
the scene for the next act in the history of France. From
these brilliant and envied centres daring witticisms crept
abroad and began to circulate in Paris. The Napoleonic
Court, the new Foreign Minister, the campaign in Spain,
the succession to the throne, were fruitful in enlivening
topics of conversation over the tea or whist tables.
Possibly the story of Erfurt was discreetly told; certainly
the story of the Archduchess Anna would prove irrepressible.
There were more serious matters. It was
observed that Talleyrand was reconciled with Fouché,
and it was known that they were daring to speculate
on the contingency of a Spanish ball finding its way to
the Emperor’s heart; though the kinder of the myth-makers
declare that the object of the new conspiracy was
merely the heart of a certain pretty lady.</p>

<p>By this time the Bonapartes and the Beauharnais
hated Talleyrand. He had never concealed his small
estimate of Napoleon’s brothers. “Say what you like
about my family,” said the Emperor with a laugh, when
he asked Talleyrand to speak to Alexander about his
want of an heir. He also warned him that Josephine
knew he favoured a divorce. They and the Foreign
Minister, and every other Napoleonist that had been
made a butt of royalist wit, now joined in reporting to
the Emperor, when he returned in January, the latest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
misdeeds of the Faubourg St. Germain. Talleyrand
had written amiable letters to Napoleon in Spain. He
had congratulated him on his victories (with, we must
remember, the usual hope that they will be made a step
to peace and the real good of Spain), and encouraged his
political action in Paris. The Corps Legislatif was giving
trouble, and Talleyrand agreed that it might be extinguished
without tyranny. In a country like France it
was only necessary to have sufficient popular representation
to vote supplies. When, therefore, Napoleon heard
of the satirical comments on his campaign and the
friendship of Talleyrand and Fouché, he determined to
strike.</p>

<p>On the day following his return, when Talleyrand
and the other Court dignitaries came before him, he
opened the sluices of his Corsican oratory. “He became
a sub-lieutenant once more,” says Meneval in recalling
his language. In the general confusion Talleyrand
alone stood “like a rock,” though the Emperor even
threatened to strike him. To Napoleon’s brutal
observation: “You did not tell me that the Duke of
San Carlos was your wife’s lover,” he quietly retorted:
“I did not think it redounded either to your Majesty’s
honour or mine.” When the Duchess de Laval asked
him afterwards why he did not knock Napoleon down
with the tongs, he said he was “too lazy.” The only
remark he made to those present, when the Emperor had
exhausted himself and departed, was: “What a pity
that such a great man had not a better education.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>”
We are often asked at this juncture by Talleyrand’s
biographers to deplore the lack of self-respect that he
betrayed in <i>not</i> seizing the tongs, or returning the
torrent of rhetoric. If he had been a bishop the same
writers would ask us to admire his superhuman fortitude.
The general reader will probably prefer an intermediate
attitude. The aphorism quoted by Lord Acton, that
such conduct belongs to one who is either more or less
than man, is pretty but absurd.</p>

<p>It is just four years from the date of this incident
to Talleyrand’s last interview with Napoleon. Those
four years are full of adventure and life for the
Napoleonist writer, but they offer little material to
the biographer of Talleyrand. Throughout them the
scene is being prepared for the next act. Wellesley is
slowly forcing his way towards the Pyrenees. The
coalition against England is gradually being converted
into the final coalition against Napoleon. Parisian
society is falling into two definite groups, Napoleonists
and people who whisper to each other that the Emperor
has no guarantee of immortality&mdash;“passengers,” in the
words which Metternich applies to Talleyrand and
Fouché; “passengers who see the helm in the hands of
a reckless pilot steering straight for the reefs, and are
ready to seize the tiller as soon as the first shock
knocks down the helmsman.”</p>

<p>Talleyrand is still, it will be remembered, Vice-Grand
Elector, and member of the Supreme Council.
But after January, 1809, he has little influence on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
the fortunes of France, and is continually offending the
Emperor. His personal relation to Napoleon is curious.
Michaud says that on the morning after the storm of
January 23rd, he was one of the first to appear at the
levee, and observers could see no trace of the events of
the previous day in his bearing. The Emperor himself
said to Roederer a few days later that “his feelings
towards Talleyrand were unchanged,” and he would
“leave him his dignities,” but would not have him
closely associated as Chamberlain. The last letter of
Talleyrand to Napoleon that we have, dated April, 1809,
is full of amiability and ostensible devotion. Three
years later, when he loses nearly the whole of his fortune,
he applies to the Emperor through Savary, and receives
two million francs for his hotel. In that year Napoleon
even wanted to recall him to the conduct of affairs. It
seems as if the two men retained, below all their political
differences and personal friction, a softening memory
of their joint achievements. But their divergence in
policy was too serious to admit further co-operation.
Napoleon saw all his hated enemies in Paris gather about
the Hotel Talleyrand, and set his spies upon it. Talleyrand
saw the Emperor reel fatally towards the precipice.</p>

<p>In the long and adventurous negotiations with the
Pope in 1809 and 1810 Talleyrand had no part. He
saw Napoleon as “successor of Charlemagne,” confiscate
the last of the temporal power, and the Ecclesiastical
Council at Paris (November 16th, 1809, to January 11th,
1810) trim and writhe before Napoleon’s theological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
queries.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> He was present when several of the bishops
were summoned to Saint Cloud, after Napoleon had
read an unsatisfactory account of the opening of their
second Council. Napoleon sat in the midst of his
Court, drinking coffee poured out by the Empress, and
singled out his uncle, Cardinal Fesch, for one of his
characteristic attacks. But “the Corsair (Fesch had fitted
out more than one privateer in 1793-5) re-appeared
at times under the cassock of the Archbishop.” The
reply was as Corsican as the attack. Napoleon rushed
on from blunder to blunder in the historical and
theological matters he was daring to discuss. “You
take me for Louis le Debonnaire,” he roared, “I’m
not. I’m Charlemagne.” The negotiations came to
nothing, and the bishops were informed “by the
minister of police” that they might return to their
dioceses.</p>

<p>Talleyrand was an idle but disgusted witness of the
subsequent abduction of the Pope, and the final defeat
of Napoleon’s aims. In January, 1810, he was present
with all the other great dignitaries and ministers at the
conference on the divorce of Josephine and re-marriage
of the Emperor. Few knew, as Talleyrand did, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
there was really no question of a Russian marriage,
when Napoleon put it to them as an open question.
When it came to his turn to speak, he advocated an
alliance with Austria. Napoleon thanked and dismissed
them; and a courier was dispatched to Vienna the same
evening. Talleyrand was present at the marriage in
April. He heard the bells of Notre Dame ring out
the ecclesiastical share in the general joy at a time when
the Pope was Napoleon’s prisoner, and listened to
Austrian congratulations at a moment when the fortifications
of Vienna were being blown up at the order of
its conqueror. A month or two afterwards he again
gave offence to the Emperor. Fouché had been
detected in negotiation with England, and Napoleon
consulted his Council as to the advisability of punishing
him. Most of the members thought Fouché should be
deposed, but could suggest no substitute for that astute
chief detective. Talleyrand said to his neighbour in a
stage-whisper: “Fouché has certainly done very wrong,
and I would find a substitute for him&mdash;but it would
be Fouché himself.” This led to Napoleon’s last
extant letter to him. “Prince of Benevento, I have
received your letter, the contents of which pained
me. During your term of office I voluntarily shut
my eyes to many things. I regret that you should
have thought fit to take a step that revives the
memory of what I have endeavoured, and will still
endeavour, to forget.” The air of righteous forbearance
is imposing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span></p>

<p>In the spring of 1812 the difference between the
two seemed to be bridged for a time. Talleyrand
was generously assisted by the Emperor in a grave
financial crisis, of which I will speak presently, and
accepted an appointment from him to a political mission.
With the long story of Napoleon’s rupture with Russia
and the opening of a fresh campaign in 1812 I am
not concerned. The friction between the two Emperors
turned largely on the question of Poland, and Napoleon
resolved to send Talleyrand on a secret mission to that
country. Some affirm that he cancelled the appointment
when he learned that Talleyrand had let it become
known to Austria by sending to Vienna for a supply
of ducats. It is likely enough that Talleyrand would
think an accidental disclosure of his mission the safest
way to avoid incurring the displeasure of Russia or
Austria. Bulwer Lytton, however, says that Napoleon
did not press the appointment because he found it
difficult to adjust with the position of his Foreign Minister,
who was to accompany him on the campaign. However
that may be, the Emperor does not seem to have felt any
particular resentment. He set out to face Russia. It
was immediately whispered in Paris that Talleyrand
declared it “the beginning of the end.”</p>

<p>Since his deposition from the chamberlainship in
1809 Talleyrand had spent a large proportion of his time
in the country. He had never been a saving man. He
liked to surround himself with things of great beauty,
to entertain lavishly, and to be extremely generous to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
servants and friends. Until 1809 he had granted a pension
of 60,000 a year to his mother,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> and greatly helped other
members of his family. He had now only the income
from his savings, and his salary as Vice-Grand Elector.
His establishment in Paris, the huge Hotel Monaco, was
very exacting; Valençay was maintained by the Emperor
for his Spanish “guests.” Savary tells us that
Talleyrand’s affairs were somewhat straitened from 1810
onwards, and he had often to appeal for the payments
for Valençay. In the general depression of 1812 a house
failed in which he was interested, and he lost fourteen
million francs. Savary says that he appealed through
him to the Emperor, who sent his architect to value the
Hotel Monaco with all its furniture, and paid him
2,100,000 francs for it. The act was a very generous one
in the circumstances, though it is perhaps not ungracious
to recall that Napoleon’s plans were responsible for the
deep commercial depression of the time. Talleyrand
happened to have a debt owing from the former Spanish
ambassador, and he now accepted that nobleman’s
mansion, the Hotel St. Florentin, in discharge of it.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>This hotel now became the centre of discontent, while
the salon of the Duchess de Bassano was the centre of
Napoleonism.</p>

<p>The following year, 1813, saw considerable movement
in the political barometers at Paris. Napoleon
had returned from Moscow about the middle of
December, and the remnants of the grand army were
beginning to reach France when he called a special
council in January to discuss the situation. He told
those present&mdash;chiefly the heads of the foreign office and
retired foreign ministers&mdash;that he desired peace, but was
in a position still to wage successful war. Should he await
overtures from Russia, or open negotiations himself,
either directly or through Austria? Maret, the actual
Foreign Minister, even less competent than Champagny,
advocated negotiations through Austria. Talleyrand
knew that Austria was seeking to detach itself from
Napoleon, and to pose as armed mediator. He therefore
gave the loyal counsel to open serious negotiations for
peace directly with Russia. To do this with any profit,
however, it would be necessary now to sacrifice some of
France’s outlying conquests, and Napoleon would not
give up even the duchy of Warsaw, and would not
withdraw from Spain unless England withdrew from
Sicily. As Talleyrand happily expressed it a little later,
the only hope of safety for Napoleon was for him “to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>become King of France.” This was impossible for him.
Talleyrand retired to his hotel, to play whist with Louis,
Dalberg, and de Pradt, and to keep his eyes open.<br /><br/></p>

(In middle age).</p></div>



<p>Within a few weeks the whist-players hear that the
people of Prussia have arisen and forced their ruler to
take up the war against Napoleon, and that Austria had
concluded a truce with Russia and withdrawn its troops.
In April they see Napoleon set out for Metz, with no
word from his Austrian ally. In May the Napoleonists
illuminate&mdash;somewhat hastily. The Emperor has won
Lutzen and Bautzen, at a terrible cost, and concluded a
forty days’ armistice. In June the Bassano Hotel
darkens again, when the news comes that England has
allied itself with Sweden, Russia, and Prussia, and that
Wellington is sweeping the French out of the Peninsula.
In August it is reported that Napoleon has rejected the
terms offered by Austria as armed mediator, and she has
joined with the continent against France. There is a
momentary flutter when a victory is claimed for the
Emperor at Dresden, but before the end of October
comes the news of Leipzig, and the tea-tables and whist-tables
buzz with excited whispers. For the second time
in twelve months the Emperor is flying towards France
with the remnant of a grand army.</p>

<p>Napoleon arrived in Paris on November 9th. His
spies and supporters could bring no allegation against
Talleyrand, who had become a very quiet spectator.
Though Napoleon’s outlying empire was virtually lost,
the allies disclaimed any intention of deposing him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
If he had been content to retire within the natural
frontiers of France, the Alps, the Rhine, and the
Pyrenees, the divisions amongst the allies would have
at this juncture sufficed to give him peace. Sick of
the mediocrity of Champagny and Maret, he now
offered the foreign ministry again to Talleyrand, who
refused it, saying later to Savary that he “did not care
to bury himself in ruins.” As he writes in his
memoirs, Napoleon was only ruined in the sense that
he could not forego his conquests and become “King
of France.” Talleyrand had no intention of flattering
his hope that a fresh co-operation of the two would
again break up the coalition and restore the empire.
It must be firmly remembered that there was at this
time no question of restoring the Bourbons. Talleyrand
was well in the counsels of Austria and Russia, and
knew that the declaration of the Allies was sincere.
His refusal meant a fresh protest against the incurable
megalomania of the Emperor. Lytton, who proves
that Talleyrand was at the time trying to inspire the
Emperor with thoughts of peace and moderation (and
we know from Pasquier that he even sent word to
Napoleon of the impending desertion of Bavaria), says
that the foreign ministry was offered to him on condition
that he gave up his other office and its salary. This,
he points out, would have made him entirely dependent
on a co-operation with Napoleon’s policy.</p>

<p>From another and well-informed source, Mme. de
Rémusat, we learn that Talleyrand and Napoleon were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
discussing the Spanish situation in a friendly way.
“You consult me as if we were not on bad terms,”
said Talleyrand. “Circumstances, circumstances,”
replied the Emperor; “let us leave the past and the
future and come to the present.” “Very well,” said
Talleyrand, “you have no choice. You have made a
mistake, and you must say so, and, as far as possible,
say it with dignity.” He advised the Emperor to
declare that his object had been “to free the Spanish
people from the yoke of a detested minister,” and that
he was now willing to restore the dynasty and withdraw
his troops. The tone of the conversation, as given in
Mme. Rémusat, is quite inconsistent with the notion
that Talleyrand had urged the invasion of Spain. The
Duc de Bassano (Maret) declares that he persuaded
the Emperor to make Ferdinand’s return conditional
on the consent of the Spanish Regency, and so delayed
the return for some months, and threw away the
Emperor’s chance of peace. We must remember how
Maret had smarted under Talleyrand’s criticisms. “I
never saw a greater donkey than Maret&mdash;unless it was
the Duc de Bassano,” he once said. We know from
a private letter to the Duchess of Courland that
Talleyrand foresaw and forewarned Napoleon of the
reluctance of the Regency. We also know from
Roederer that he urged in December the unconditional
return of Ferdinand to Spain. Napoleon wanted to
release his armies from the Peninsula, but at the same
time to keep the English from passing on to France.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
It was his own vacillation between his hopes and fears
that prevented him from making definite terms. Over
and over again at this period he falls back on Talleyrand’s
advice, a month or so after the situation has changed
against him, and the Allies will no longer entertain it<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>.</p>

<p>The Spanish princes left Valençay on March 3rd.
Castellane says that there was not a piece of furniture or
china intact in the chateau after their six years’ stay.
They left a memorial in the shape of their medieval
chariot, which declined to move towards its ancestral
home, and was long exhibited at Valençay. Talleyrand
writes a singularly bitter passage on the English in
describing Ferdinand’s return. He complains that,
while they boasted of being “the saviours of Spain,”
they failed to secure proper guarantees that the
unamiable Ferdinand should not abuse his power on
returning. “They only hate tyranny abroad when, as
under Napoleon, it threatens their existence, and they
love to make the subjection of peoples turn to the profit
of their pride and their prosperity.” One would like to
know the state of his health when he wrote this very
exceptional sentence.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span></p>
<p>The last interview with Napoleon was tempestuous.
In January (1814), a few days before he rejoined the
army, the Emperor again chose a public occasion to abuse
him, and threatened to punish him severely on the first
complaint. “You are a coward, a traitor, a thief. You
don’t even believe in God. You have betrayed and
deceived everybody. You would sell your own father.”
Talleyrand stood quietly by the fire; not a muscle of
his face or body was seen to move. One of the witnesses
told Lytton that he seemed to be the last person in the
room interested in what the Emperor said. His critics
enlarge here again on his “lack of self-respect.” There
could not be a more perverse and malevolent interpretation
of an admirable bearing. On this occasion,
however, Talleyrand immediately wrote to the Emperor
offering to resign his place on the Council. It was not
accepted. Napoleon had told him some time before
that if anything happened to himself he would see that
Talleyrand did not survive him. Within a few months
he used language which almost implied a regret that he
had not had Talleyrand shot. They never saw each
other again. In less than three months the Empire was
at an end.</p>

<p>In a private letter written immediately after this
incident Talleyrand spoke of it with great moderation
and sadness. His correspondent was the Duchess of
Courland, who now appears, almost for the first time, in
the story of his life. There is no other woman who has
been addressed by him with such passionate and devoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
language as this beautiful Russo-German princess. After
the death of her husband in 1801 she lived chiefly at
Mittau, but paid an occasional visit to Paris. It must
have been during one of these visits that Talleyrand first
met her. We do not know the year, but it cannot have
been long before he sought the hand of her daughter for
his nephew in 1808. She would then be in her forty-seventh
year, and her daughter, Dorothy, in her fifteenth.
The romanticists (strongly reinforced in this instance by
the fertile imagination of George Sand) have, of course,
given a sensual character to the attachment, and have
thrown out ludicrous hints that Dorothy (born years
before we have any reason to think he had met the
duchess at all), who succeeded the mother in his
affections, was his daughter. All this is pure wantonness.
We can understand without their aid the ardent
friendship that we find in 1814 between the refined
statesman of sixty and the graceful and gracious lady of
fifty-three. She was a woman of great charm, many
accomplishments, high intelligence and character, and no
mean political faculty. “No woman in the world was
more worthy of adoration,” said Talleyrand long afterwards.
The score of short letters he wrote her during
1814 are full of such expressions as “my angel.”</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">THE RESTORATION</span></p>


<p>Napoleon had left Paris for the field towards the close
of January, and the strain of expectation became intense.
All knew now that the empire trembled in the balance.
The English and Spaniards had crossed the Pyrenees
since the middle of November, and were welcomed by
the peasants of the south as deliverers. The northern
allies had crossed the Rhine on December 21st. Already
the imagination could see Napoleon and his capital
hemmed between the converging forces. The group of
whist-players at the Hotel St. Florentin dropped their
voices to lower whispers, as the news came stealthily
through the screen of spies and censors. “Burn this
letter” appears time after time at the foot of the brief
notes to the Duchess of Courland. In one letter he tells
her that he has sent a totally different and misleading
message by post, because he knows it will be opened.
Another, probably sent by post instead of the usual friendly
bearer, ends with the postcript: “My letters are opened.
Those who read them will discover that I love you,
which concerns you and me alone. After all, I only send
news that is being cried in the streets. This interruption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
of a confidential exchange of thoughts is sad for those
who wish to renounce the affairs of the world.”</p>

<p>The thoughts of the hermit were then as vigorously
bent on “the affairs of the world” as ever in his whole
career. Was the future to be a Napoleon with clipped
wings? Was it to be a regency? Bernadotte? the
Bourbons? He had several channels of information,
and was not affected by the rigid censorship that ruled
Paris. He knew well the march of military events,
but was painfully perplexed as to the political view of
the Allies. He holds in his memoirs that up to the
middle of March they were prepared to treat with
Napoleon, and hardly gave a thought to the Bourbons.
But the Emperor was obstinate. He saw with rage the
vast empire slipping from his grasp. At the beginning
of February he sent his Foreign Minister to treat with
the Allies at Chatillon, but as usual insisted on terms too
arrogant for his situation. “Talleyrand would have got
me out of the difficulty,” he said, when he heard of
Caulaincourt’s failure. It was not the first time the
remark had been wrung from him. But Talleyrand
rightfully says he could have done nothing of the kind.
If the Emperor had gained a slight success the day
after Talleyrand had secured reasonable terms, he would
have disowned them.</p>

<p>The “table de whist”&mdash;a phrase of the time&mdash;listened
to the daily messages with great impatience.
“The man is a corpse, but he doesn’t stink yet,” said
Dalberg of Napoleon. “All he can hope for now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>”
said de Pradt, Archbishop of Malines, another of the
inner group, “is a million francs and a frigate at Brest.”
Talleyrand kept quiet, but wrote to the Duchess of
Courland that “uncertainty was the worst of all evils.”
He was being closely watched. One day in the middle
of February he and Baron Louis, Mgr. de Pradt, and
Dalberg were discussing the situation, when Savary, the
new detective-in-chief, burst into the room. “Ah!”
he said, with a forced laugh, “I catch you all red-handed.”
Towards the end of February they sent
Baron Vitrolles, a royalist, to the representatives of the
Allies to glean something of their intention as to the
future. Dalberg gave him as credentials his seal and
the names of two Viennese ladies who were known to
Count Stadion. When Vitrolles asked if he was to
have no message from Talleyrand, Dalberg said: “You
don’t know that monkey: he won’t risk burning his
finger tips, even if all the chestnuts go to himself.”
He was, however, given a short, unsigned note in
invisible ink for Count Nesselrode.</p>

<p>Talleyrand was already secretly assured of the
goodwill of Louis XVIII. Several years earlier, when
someone suggested that he ought to have an understanding
with the possible king, he replied that his
uncle, the Archbishop, was at Hartwell. At the same
time he discharged his duties as Councillor of the
Empress to the best of his judgment. Napoleon had
warned Joseph against his advice, and had even ordered
Savary to expel him. Savary refused on the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
that Talleyrand alone kept the Faubourg St. Germain
in check.</p>

<p>Towards the close of March news came that the
allied forces were marching on Paris&mdash;were already
between Napoleon and his capital. Country folk began
to pour in, flying before the advancing Prussians and
Russians. On the evening of the 28th Joseph assembled
the Council at the Tuileries for the last time. Talleyrand
advised that the Empress should remain in Paris. He
spoke on a perfectly loyal and judicious estimate of
the circumstances, and nearly every member of the
Council agreed with him. Then Joseph read a letter
from his brother, directing the retreat of the Empress
and her son to Blois. The members of the Council
were to follow. As Talleyrand left the room he
halted for a moment at the top of the staircase, and
said to Savary: “So this is the end of it all! Don’t
you think so? The Emperor is to be pitied, but he
will get no sympathy, because his obstinacy in retaining
such incompetent people about him has no reasonable
motive. What a fool! To give his name to an
adventure, when he might have given it to his age.
We must see what is to be done. It is not everybody
who cares to bury himself in these ruins.” The
following day he sent two envoys to the head-quarters
of the Allies at Dijon. He gave them a letter of
introduction to Stein, who was in favour of a restoration
of the Bourbons, and who was urged “to prevent the
frightful consequences of a wrong choice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span></p>

<p>Faster ran the pace when, on the morning of the
30th, the allied armies reached the outskirts of Paris.
All that day the roar of artillery and the rattle of
musketry kept people in suspense. At night Marshals
Marmont and Mortier came in, black with dust and
smoke, and it was agreed to capitulate. Talleyrand had
been ordered to follow the Empress to Blois, as a
member of her Council. He asked Savary to authorise
him to stay, but the Minister refused, and instructed
the police to see that he went. Pasquier, however,
mentioned to him the barrier at which Rémusat commanded,
and Talleyrand, sending a message to his friend
Mme. de Rémusat, set out with great ceremony in his
state carriage. He was, of course, forbidden to pass
the barrier, and returned to the Hotel St. Florentin.
In his judgment Napoleon was not yet certified to be
dead. Michaud, the devoted leader of the “true
royalists” in Paris, who were contemptuously ignored
by Talleyrand, says the crowd wanted to pitch him in
the Seine. Michaud was to write Talleyrand’s biography
as soon as he was dead, and it was to be
taken as authoritative by judicious people like Sainte
Beuve.</p>

<p>At eight in the morning Count Nesselrode and a
Cossack enter Paris, and gallop between the great
crowds to the Hotel St. Florentin. Talleyrand, just
dressing, covers the Russian envoy with embraces and
powder. While they are talking, a message comes from
the Tsar to say that he hears the Elysée Palace, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
which he was to stay, has been undermined. Talleyrand
puts his hotel at the Tsar’s disposal. Nesselrode
and he redact a proclamation, and entrust the printing
of it to Michaud. At two in the afternoon Caulaincourt
comes from Napoleon. At four the allied forces
defile along the Champs Elysées, and Alexander arrives.
He had previously given orders that Talleyrand was to
be detained, by force, if necessary, at Paris; he was
the necessary man. Michaud admits that his activity
was “prodigious” that day. In the evening Alexander,
the King of Prussia, Prince Schwartzenberg and others
discussed the situation with Talleyrand and Dalberg.
Talleyrand demanded the restoration of the monarchy.
“With the return of the Bourbons France would cease
to be gigantic, and would become great once more.”
To the foreigners he pointed out that the only alternative
to Napoleon that rested on a principle was the
re-establishment of the Bourbons. The Tsar was not
at all convinced that the country wanted the Bourbons,
but Talleyrand promised to get a vote of the Senate to
that effect, and produced the Declaration he had printed.
When Napoleon’s envoy arrived to treat with the Allies,
Alexander showed him the Declaration. The reign of
Napoleon was over. Talleyrand had restored the
monarchy. Napoleon remarked when he heard it:
“Talleyrand was a good servant. I treated him badly
without making him powerless. It was a great mistake.
Now he has taken his revenge on me. The Bourbons
will avenge me by throwing him over within six months.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>”
There is no trace in the whole of Talleyrand’s career
of “revenge.” It was, like zeal, one of the passions
he thought it unprofitable to cultivate. He restored
the monarchy, partly because he knew Napoleon, partly
because he did not yet know Louis XVIII. He knew
Napoleon would never sit in peace within the old
frontiers of France, or refrain from meddling with a
regency. Castellane rightly points out that he had
much to fear under Louis, but would have had an
assured influence under a regency. He acted in what
must have seemed to be the interest of the country.</p>

<p>He at once set to work to secure the allegiance
of Paris. Bourrienne, Pasquier, and others quickly
deserted Napoleon. He won over many of the senators
in Paris, and sent his friends to others. When the
Senate met under his presidency on April 1st, it
appointed a provisional government consisting of&mdash;Michaud
bitterly says&mdash;“the whist-table,” and a few
others. Talleyrand was president, with Dalberg, Jaucourt,
Beurnonville, and Montesquiou as colleagues, and Louis
and Beugnot and others as ministers. Michaud says
they helped themselves freely to the funds. Talleyrand
claims that their provisional administration was a miracle
of economy. Its budget for seventeen busy days was
only two million francs. On the following day the
Senate deposed Napoleon, with rather needless emphasis.
The Legislative Body supported it. Benjamin Constant
wrote to congratulate Talleyrand on having “at once
destroyed tyranny and laid the foundations of liberty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>”
“There is a noble consistency in your life,” he said,
“between 1789 and 1814.”<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>Talleyrand was in good spirits when he saw the
smooth run of events. His friend de Pradt was piqued
at being left out of the provisional government, and
complained that he had no opportunity of helping. Talleyrand
recollected that it was April 1st. He told de Pradt
that he could render great assistance by joining in an
attempt to evoke a royalist demonstration. They were
both to leave the hotel waving their white handkerchiefs,
and proceed in different directions along the boulevards.
Talleyrand returned to the hotel as soon as de Pradt’s
back was turned, and left the Archbishop to run the
gauntlet of the crowd with his Bourbon flag. The
National Guard had refused to replace the tricolour by
the white cockade.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p>But there were more anxious hours before the final
settlement. Napoleon had still a considerable force, and
talked of retaking Paris. On April 4th his marshals
forced him to abdicate in favour of his son, and three of
them came to the Hotel St. Florentin to inform the
Tsar. The provisional government was at that moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
assembled in Talleyrand’s rooms on the ground floor,
and had drawn up the invitation to the King’s brother
to advance to Paris. Alexander now spoke again in
favour of a regency, and Talleyrand replied that it
would mean the Napoleonic rule in disguise. The
Tsar wavered between the politicians and the soldiers,
until at last a messenger broke in on the discussion with
the news that one of Napoleon’s generals had deserted
with 12,000 men. On the 5th the Allies rejected
Napoleon’s proposal; on the 6th the Senate proclaimed
Louis XVIII, and Napoleon abdicated at Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>Then began the pitiful story of the men who
“forgot nothing and learned nothing,” the King and his
emigrant courtiers. Imagining that Europe had, out of
respect for the divine right of kings, drawn the flat of its
style over the tablets of the last twenty years, they
marched into France without a glance at the real spirit
of the people. A messenger came to tell Talleyrand
that the Count d’Artois would make his entry into Paris
on April 12th as the King’s deputy. Talleyrand calmly
told him he was ready to hand over the reins of the
provisional government to him. He had worked with
the Senate for days at a constitution after the model of
the English, with a hereditary Senate, an elective second
chamber, freedom of worship, and open access to office
for all Frenchmen. They invited the late King’s brother
to ascend the throne as soon as he would adopt on oath
the new constitution. This meant to the infatuated
royalists that the roots of republicanism were still alive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
The Tsar was less patient of their folly than Talleyrand.
He gave them to understand that the King would forfeit
the support of Europe if he did not accept the
constitution; though Talleyrand admitted the possibility
of changes in detail.</p>

<p>The Count d’Artois greeted Talleyrand with
cordiality, and was too overcome with emotion to do
more than stammer an expression of his joy. Beugnot
tells how Talleyrand directed him afterwards to report,
or rather construct, the scene for the <i>Moniteur</i>. After
several attempts Beugnot made the Prince say:
“Nothing is changed. There is one Frenchman more
in France&mdash;that is all.” “That is what he <i>did</i> say,”
said Talleyrand; “I answer for it.” The pretty speech&mdash;leagues
removed from the real one&mdash;was scattered over
the country in the <i>Moniteur</i>. Talleyrand had once
defended d’Artois against Napoleon’s disdain, but he
now saw with concern that the Prince’s watch had
stopped at 1789. To the address of the Senate,
delivered by Talleyrand, he only replied with a vague
assurance that the King would be sure to accept the
main lines of their constitution. Dispatching a Liberal
noble, the Duke de Liancourt, to Hartwell, Talleyrand
turned to the negotiations with the Allies until the King
should arrive.</p>

<p>When someone had expressed to him a fear that the
King might prove unreasonable, Talleyrand replied
optimistically that Nature had put a man’s eyes in front,
not at the back, of his head. It was, however, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
grave misgiving that he went to meet Louis XVIII at
Compiègne on April 29th. Cold, cynical and selfish in
person, surrounded by evil and incompetent councillors,
folded complacently in the outworn mantle of Capetian
divinity, Louis XVIII came rather with an idea of
forgiveness than of conciliation. He had enough
perception of the situation to admit in the letter some
scheme of constitutional monarchy, but he had not
surrendered a particle of the medieval doctrine of divine
right. Nothing was more remote from his mind than
the idea of receiving sovereignty from the people and
holding it on their conditions. With such a man
co-operation was only possible as long as Talleyrand
could prove himself to be indispensable. He was
steeped in the convenient fiction that ministers serve
the crown, so that its wearer escapes the burden of
ingratitude. For such men Talleyrand would soon
say, bitterly enough, “By the grace of God” is a
protocol of ingratitude. As to the King’s surroundings
he had no illusion. When someone asked him whether
he thought them capable of saving France, he replied:
“Why not? The geese saved the Capitol.”</p>

<p>King and king-maker met at the royal chateau of
Compiègne. Talleyrand declares that the King received
him with compliments; an eye-witness, Beugnot,
describes him as ironically polite and very kingly.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>When Talleyrand broached the subject of the constitution,
the King brushed aside his plea for tact and
consideration with a courtly sneer. “You wish me to
accept a constitution from you, and you don’t wish to
accept a constitution from me. That is very natural;
but in that case, my dear M. Talleyrand, I should be
standing and you seated.” Talleyrand saw that his
worst fears as to the conduct of the returned emigrants&mdash;whom
he would soon call “the foreigners of the
interior”&mdash;were likely to be realised. In the end the
King asked him, with some suspicion of irony, how he
had been able to upset in succession the Directory and
Bonaparte. Talleyrand saw his opportunity. “I did
nothing at all, Sire,” he replied. “There seems to be
an inexplicable something in me that brings bad luck
to governments that neglect me.” This, at all events,
is the current version of the interview. The mythopæic
faculty has evidently been at work. It is safe to
assume that the King was cold, cynical, polite and
tactless.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="caption">LOUIS XVIII.</p></div>


<p>Two days later the Tsar reached Compiègne, and
endeavoured in vain to induce the King to surrender
his illusions. The Senate was also brought from Paris,
and was introduced by Talleyrand. “You succeed to
twenty years of ruin and misery. Such a heritage might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>frighten an ordinary virtue,” he said gravely to the
pompous mediocrity before him. His sense of humour
seems to have failed him when, after pleading for a
“constitutional charter,” he went on: “<i>You</i> know even
better than we do, Sire, that such institutions, so well
approved among a neighbouring people, lend support
to, and do not put restraint on, monarchs who love
the laws and are the fathers of their people.” It was
all of very little avail. An English caricature of the
time represents the banquet at Compiègne that night,
with the Tsar, the Emperor of Austria, the King of
Prussia, Prince Schwartzenberg, Blücher, Bernadotte,
and the leading figures amongst the Allies and in France
around the tables. Talleyrand sits in silence at one end
of the room, but a thread passes from his hand to each
of the other diners, as if they were puppets under his
control. The truth is that Talleyrand had now encountered
one of the most serious difficulties of his career.
All his diplomacy fell before the royal system of filling
the ante-chamber with sleek, cunning, incompetent
favourites and flatterers. The King refused to take
the oath to the new constitution, or to adopt the
moderate proclamation prepared by Talleyrand. His
satellites prepared one more in accord with his inflated
pretensions&mdash;the Declaration of St. Ouen&mdash;and posted
it throughout Paris. It gave a constitution to the
nation instead of receiving one from the people’s representatives.
Providence had restored the throne, and
to Providence, rather than statesmanship, it was to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
confided. In ten months the king would be flying
ignobly for the frontier.</p>

<p>However, Louis XVIII had accepted the substance
of Talleyrand’s constitution, and he gave the guarantees
which were to dispel the expectation of vindictiveness.
Talleyrand returned to Paris to prepare for his reception,
which was at least orderly. A few days afterwards he
was appointed Foreign Minister and Grand Almoner to
the King’s household. There is a story that after he
had taken the oath of loyalty to the King he observed
to him: “That is my thirteenth oath of loyalty, Sire,
and I trust it will be the last.” History had another in
reserve for him&mdash;the oath to Louis Philippe. Although
he afterwards spoke strongly of the peers who had
“violated the religion of the oath” during the Hundred
Days, he had not a great awe of that ceremony. He is
said to have described it once as “the ticket you take
at the door of the theatre.” Speaking once of cheeses,
he declared that the Brie was the king of cheeses; he
had thought so in his youth and thought so still.
Eugène Sue observed that he had “taken no oath to
that royalty.” On another occasion, when he had to
administer the oath to a pretty lady, he said, with a
glance at her ankles: “That is a very short skirt to
take an oath of fidelity in.”</p>

<p>Not only was Talleyrand omitted from the committee
appointed to frame the new constitution, but its
members were strictly forbidden to confer with him on
the subject. He was jealously excluded from influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
on home affairs, and he saw with increasing bitterness
the gradual emergence of the worst faults of the old
regime. One of the restored nobles went about complaining
that he did not feel free as long as the press
was free. Another was advocating that the King’s
ministers must be “people of quality,” with the real
workers as drudges under their control. But the task
of completing the settlement with the Allies still
engrossed his attention for some time. Barante
describes how Nesselrode or Metternich or other
ministers would drop in as Talleyrand was dressing in
the morning, and discuss the situation. It was no light
work to effect a generous settlement, with the King
forcing on him exorbitant pretensions and the Prussians
thirsting to avenge Jena. Talleyrand succeeded by his
personal influence in attaching England and Austria,
and so defeating the righteous demands of Prussia.
In the end he was able to hand over to the King
a considerably larger France than Louis XVI
had ruled, an army of 300,000 men, all the
works of art that the Directory and Napoleon
had “imported,” and a complete acquittance of all claims
for indemnity. While foreign ministers were being
severely censured for admitting such terms, Talleyrand
had to listen to vapid complaints of their insufficiency
amongst the Court party. The King’s young nephew,
the Duc de Berry, was especially talkative. “You seem
to have been in a great hurry to sign that unhappy
treaty,” he said one day. “Yes, Monseigneur,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
Talleyrand. “I was in a great hurry. There are
senators who say I was in a great hurry to get the crown
offered to your royal house.” Another day the
pretentious young prince was boasting what they would
do with the army that had been restored to France by
Talleyrand surrendering the fortresses. Talleyrand, who
was sitting quietly near, got up and blandly reminded
him that this army had been obtained by the “unhappy
treaty” he had signed with the Allies. He actually
heard courtiers talk of making war on the Allies with
this army. The Tsar was deeply disgusted, and began
to regret the return of the Bourbons. Talleyrand made
every effort to prevent his alienation from the King.
“The King has studied our history: he knows us.
Liberal principles are advancing with the spirit of the
age.” He wrote these things at a time when he saw the
whole country being disposed to welcome a return of
Napoleon.</p>

<p>The three months that followed the conclusion of
the treaty with the Allies were spent in preparation for
the coming Congress and uneasy observation of internal
development. Some of the smaller sovereigns set up by
the Peace of Paris entered on their domains at once, but
the definitive settlement of the map of Europe was postponed
to a Congress to be held at Vienna in the autumn.
At this Congress Talleyrand would have to meet a
formidable effort on the part of the diplomatists he had
just discomfited, and skilfully to evade the inflated
directions that the courtiers were pressing upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
King. His first care was to part on good terms with
the ministers who were to reunite at Vienna. His
personal qualities and the general recognition of the
fact that he had endeavoured throughout to moderate
the bloody march of Napoleon favoured his effort, but
there was a feeling that he had secured too much for
France, and a plot was forming to exclude him by some
stratagem from the important discussions at Vienna. It
was, moreover, visible to all that the Tsar was entirely
surrendering his protection of France. The Prussian
ministers departed with bitter determination to press
their claims at Vienna. The Tsar went off to England
with a mortified feeling of having been betrayed into a
blunder by Talleyrand. With the English ministers
Talleyrand retained good relations, though he had (as
usual) little respect for their diplomatic gifts. “What
a prodigious amount these English do not know!” he
said afterwards, <i>à propos</i> of Castlereagh, who was at Paris
with his brother and Lord Cathcart. Lord Wellington
came to Paris as ambassador in August, and became a
great admirer and friend of the French Foreign
Minister.</p>

<p>At the house of Mme. de Staël, who was once
more shining in Paris, the Liberals and Constitutionalists
discussed the situation with concern. The whole policy
initiated by Napoleon of the open career was being
discarded. Degrees of “attachment” to the exiled
royal family were made the sole grounds of qualification
for office amongst the crowd of incompetent claimants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span></p>

<p>“Regicides” were marked out as excluded from
all honour and position. When Talleyrand protested
that this was no reason for rejecting the abler and more
useful of the Republicans, the King pleaded that his
courtiers would not tolerate them. The King’s chief
confidant, Blacas, replied to all suggestions of the
dangers they were incurring with a lofty declaration
that there could be no compromise between truth and
error, between the monarchy and the revolution.
Talleyrand by this time knew how to wait, and fell
back on that attitude. His only action in the Senate,
to which he belonged, was to defend the proposals of
the new Minister of Finance, his friend, Baron Louis.</p>

<p>On the other hand he made careful preparation for
the campaign at Vienna. The first thing to do was to
discover the aims and intentions of the four great
Powers, and that did not take him long. The treaties
that had knit together the coalition against Napoleon
were based on a partition of the territory to be wrested
from him. Napoleon’s ruthless clipping and maiming
of Austria and Prussia had to be amended, and those
Powers demanded a heavy discount. Prussia hoped to
get Saxony, Lower Pomerania, part of Poland, and the
Rhine districts from Mayence to Holland. The Tsar,
whose plans were sufficiently revealed to Talleyrand
during the few weeks’ stay at the Hotel St. Florentin,
desired the whole of Poland (with a separate constitution,
but under the Russian Crown). Thus the claims
of the two most covetous Powers were inconsistent with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
each other and inacceptable to Austria, who was especially
unwilling to compensate the King of Saxony in Italy.
England had already secured Hanover and the independence
of the Netherlands, and was not further
interested in Europe, except in the balancing of the
Powers against each other; but she was bound by the
treaties signed.</p>

<p>Talleyrand fully informed himself of the views of
the Powers, and formed the plan he afterwards followed
with brilliant success. He would pose as the dignified
and disinterested representative of principle in this game
of grab. Partly under directions from the King, partly
from reasons of personal regard or interest, he determined
to frustrate Prussia’s design on Saxony and to
secure the restoration of Naples to Sicily. Here the
opportunist and democratic Talleyrand would plead the
principle of legitimacy. As England was the least
interested of the Powers he would win her first to his
new fervour for principles, and Austria, with her interests
mainly southern and a natural concern at any undue
growth of Prussia and Russia, might be drawn with them
against the northern Powers. But the first difficulty was to
get a hearing. By one of the earlier treaties (Chaumont)
the four Powers had agreed to exclude France from the
deliberations respecting the division of the territory won
from her. Prussia was bent on having this condition
carried out, and Russia and Austria had no reason as yet
to depart from it. Talleyrand prepared the way for his
attack on this formidable obstacle to his plans by a close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
and assiduous cultivation of England. He impressed
effusively on the English Ambassador, first Sir Charles
Stuart and then Lord Wellington, the identity of the
interests, or the disinterestedness, of France and England,
and brought about a feeling of cordiality. Castlereagh
himself stopped at Paris for a few days on the way to
Vienna, and was much interviewed.</p>

<p>The next step was to prepare the personnel of the
French party and the indirect machinery of diplomacy.
He chose Dalberg, partly as a small reward to his friend
and partly “to let out secrets” at Vienna, and La
Besnardière to do the substantial work of the legation.
Of the two royalists who accompanied him, the Count de
Noailles (a moderate) and M. de Latour du Pin, he says
that as he knew he would have to take some of the
Court party to watch him, he preferred to have them of
his own choosing. The latter would be able “to sign
passports.” He also took his nephew’s charming and
tactful wife, the Countess Edmond de Périgord, to
entertain for him. She proved “very useful” in breaking
down the social boycott with which hostile ministers
tried to support their resolve to exclude Talleyrand
from the settlement. They rented the Hotel Kaunitz
at Vienna, and some of the most brilliant fêtes and most
attractive dinners of the ensuing winter were given there.</p>

<p>The last point was to obtain suitable instructions
from the King, or, rather, give sober instructions to
Louis XVIII. He therefore drew up a long memorandum
and programme, and got it signed by the King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
without difficulty. The French representatives at the
Congress were to see that things were done in order and
on principle. The Congress would have to settle what
States should be represented in it, what its objects were,
and how they were to be attained. In this regard the
Treaty of May 30th must be followed, which promises a
<i>general</i> Congress. The idea of a “Power” must be taken
in a wide sense, and all the States, large or small, that
took part in the war must be admitted. The small
German States should be formed into a confederation,
and the Congress cannot accomplish this without their
assistance. In the distribution of territory it must be
remembered that modern Europe does not recognize
that sovereignty may be obtained by mere conquest, and
without the abdication of the conquered sovereign.
“Sovereignty is, in the general society of Europe, what
private ownership is in a particular civil society.” On
this principle Saxony and the other German States must
be dealt with. The Congress has to dispose of the
territory renounced by France, and the principles of
public right must guide the distribution. Balance of
power does not mean equality of force. Small States
must be preserved, and, <i>à fortiori</i>, Saxony, whose king
has been a father to his people, a beneficent ruler.
France must protect the little States against the larger;
must see that Prussia does not get Mayence or any
territory left of the Moselle, and so on. Poland is to
be reconstructed, on condition that its restoration is
entire and complete. England being equally conservative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
with France as to the state of Europe must be cultivated
as an ally. In the end the memorandum lays down four
chief points on which the representatives of France must
insist, whatever concession they make apart from them.
These are: 1. That Austria shall not obtain the States
of the King of Sardinia for one of its princes; 2. That
Naples shall be restored to Ferdinand IV.; 3. That the
<i>whole</i> of Poland shall not pass under the sovereignty of
Russia; 4. That Prussia shall not get Saxony&mdash;“at
least, not the whole of it”&mdash;nor Mayence.</p>

<p>Had these four points been submitted to any other
ambassador at the Congress beforehand he would have
smiled. We have now to see how Talleyrand secured
every one of them in the face of tremendous opposition.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">A DIPLOMATIC ROMANCE</span></p>


<p>Talleyrand and his party arrived at Vienna on
September 23rd. He immediately saw the representatives
of the other great Powers, found that his
anticipation of their resolve to restrict his action was
correct, and opened his campaign. It was not a difficult
task to induce the ministers of the secondary Powers to
make common cause with the ablest diplomatist at the
Congress. The Spanish Minister, Labrador, was urged
to press the disputable claim of his country to be
considered a first-class Power, and support Talleyrand
in his man&oelig;uvres. The smaller States were fully disposed
to have their feeble voices swelled into a
respectable protest by fitting them into Talleyrand’s
scheme. The representatives of Prussia (Prince
Hardenberg and Baron Humboldt), of Russia (Nesselrode,
Stakelberg and Rassoumoffsky), of Austria
(Metternich), and of England (Castlereagh and Stewart),
were in constant correspondence. Talleyrand waited
and watched. At last he inquired of Metternich why
there was no indication of the opening of the Congress,
which had been fixed for October 1st. After some
discussion between the four Powers, Metternich and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
Nesselrode obtained that Talleyrand and the Spanish
Minister should be invited to assist at a preliminary
conference on September 30th, and the diplomatic
struggle begins.</p>

<p>Talleyrand at once sees Labrador and arranges the
reply to Metternich’s note. He himself replies that he
will be pleased to meet the other Powers, in which
he carefully includes Spain; Labrador, in accepting,
puts France at the head of the Powers he is prepared
to discuss with. When Talleyrand reached the Foreign
Chancellery he finds all the chief ministers seated at a
long table, and he drops into a vacant chair between
Castlereagh, who presided, and Metternich. He immediately
throws in the apple of discord by asking why he
alone of the French legation is invited. When he is
told that only the chiefs of the various legations are
summoned, he asks why Baron von Humboldt represents
Prussia as well as Prince Hardenberg. They point out
delicately that Hardenberg is rather deaf, and he
smilingly refers to his own lameness. “We all have
our infirmities, and have the same right to profit by
them.” But this is only a trivial point raised in order
to induce nervousness; as is also his support of the
Portuguese Minister’s claim (inspired by himself) to
be admitted. Castlereagh opens the proceedings, and
says they have first to inform Talleyrand and Labrador
what has been done. The protocol (minutes) of the
previous conferences is handed to Talleyrand. He
raised his eyebrows in artistic astonishment when he finds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
that it contains the word “Allies” in every paragraph.
Who are these “Allies?” Are we “still at Chaumont?”
He had supposed that the war was over. They hastily&mdash;much
too hastily&mdash;assure him that it is a mere form
or phrase, and he continues to read about treaties
and agreements that had been concealed or were
supposed to be concealed from him. “I don’t
understand it,” he says, returning the papers. “I don’t
know of anything being done on these dates.” The
only date he knows anything of is October 1st, when
the Congress is to begin. The other ministers, thrown
off their guard by his unforeseen tactics, abandon their
protocol as unimportant, and it is not seen again. They
then produce a document regulating the procedure of
the Congress, and invite him and Labrador to sign it.
He reads it, hesitates, and says it needs leisurely
consideration. It may be that only the Congress itself
can give the representatives of the four Powers the
faculties they have assumed. Castlereagh and himself,
he points out, are responsible to their nations, and must
proceed cautiously. Castlereagh rather assents, and the
Prussians fume. Something is said of “the King of
Naples.” “Who is he?” asks Talleyrand. Humboldt
ventures to say that the Powers have guaranteed Murat
his territory. “But they could not, and, therefore, they
did not,” insists Talleyrand.</p>

<p>The conference broke up amid a general air of
embarrassment. I have taken the account of it from
Talleyrand’s memoirs and his report to the King.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
But the Secretary of the Congress, Gentz, who soon
formed a profound admiration of Talleyrand, describes
it as a scene he could never forget, and says that all the
intrigues of the ministers were defeated. Like Napoleon,
Talleyrand believed in setting ajar the nerves of his
diplomatic opponents, but he had also made a substantial
attack on the plot to exclude France. The minutes of
the previous meetings were destroyed, and no more
meetings were held to which the French Minister was
not invited.</p>

<p>The next morning he followed up his advantage
by submitting a note on the procedure of the Congress.
He claimed, plausibly enough, that the representatives
of the eight Powers who had signed the Treaty of Paris
(where the Congress was decided on) should appoint a
commission to prepare its programme. This would let
in Portugal and Sweden, as well as France and Spain.
Baron Humboldt described it as “a torch flung amongst
us.” Metternich and Castlereagh beg him to withdraw
his note. Talleyrand explains that this is impossible as
it has somehow leaked out, and the Spanish Minister
has unfortunately (but at Talleyrand’s secret suggestion)
sent a copy of it to his Court. Metternich threatens
that the four Powers will act by themselves. Talleyrand
amiably replies that in that event he will not feel called
upon to attend the Congress. Nesselrode bluntly protests
that the Tsar must leave Austria by the 29th, and
Talleyrand suavely assures him he “is very sorry, as in
that case the Tsar is not likely to see the end of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>Congress.” Castlereagh endeavours to talk over Talleyrand
with British common sense. The objects of France
can be secured, he is explaining, when Talleyrand
interrupts him with an expression of lofty amazement,
and says France is there to represent principles, not to
secure objects. They have to answer to Europe, which
has suffered so much from the neglect of good maxims
of conduct. Von Gagern, representing Bavaria, said:
“Is it not extraordinary that, when the French speak of
principles for the first time since the world began no
one will listen to them?” Gentz admitted to Talleyrand
at dinner that night that the other Powers knew he was
right, but did not like to retreat. He wished Talleyrand
had arrived earlier.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="caption">PRINCE METTERNICH.</p></div>



<p>The Tsar had already granted him the interview
he had asked on arriving at Vienna. In answer to
Alexander’s inquiry as to the state of France he gave a
very cheerful (and totally untrue) account. He had
just received pitiable reports from Fouché and
D’Hauterive. When the Tsar spoke of needs or
interests deciding what was to be done in Europe,
Talleyrand reminded him that right came before
interest. “The interests of Europe constitute right,”
said the Tsar. Talleyrand raised his head and dropped
his arms, ejaculating: “Poor Europe!” When he
remonstrated with Alexander for using the word
“Allies,” the Emperor explained it away as being due
to force of habit. A few days afterwards he saw
Metternich, and humorously alluded to “the Allies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>”
“There are none now,” said Metternich. When
Metternich tried to smile at his affectation of disinterestedness,
Talleyrand offered to sign a note to the
effect that France wanted nothing and would not accept
anything from the Congress. Metternich mentioned
Naples, and Talleyrand at once said it was a question
of principle.</p>

<p>The Congress was now a week overdue, and the
irritated ministers saw all their preparations for it
thwarted. The Prussian party had been strengthened
by their minister from London, one of the “eagles
of their diplomacy,” but they could make no headway.
On October 8th there was another conference. Talleyrand
delivered to Castlereagh another note on the
Congress, and wanted it stated that it would be held
“in conformity with the principles of public right.”
Hardenberg jumped up, and, with his fists clenched on
the table, snapped out that “that went without saying.”
“It will be all the easier to insert it,” replied Talleyrand.
Baron Humboldt then took up the quarrel, and wanted
to know “what they had to do with public right.” “It
is in virtue of public right that you are here,” retorted
Talleyrand quietly. The phrase did eventually appear
in the Declaration. In the middle of the Conference
Castlereagh drew Talleyrand aside, and asked him if he
would be “easier” if they gave him his point. “What
will you do about Naples if I promise?” immediately
asked the moralist. Castlereagh promised his assistance.</p>

<p>Thus the opening stages of the diplomatic campaign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
went entirely in Talleyrand’s favour. He had advised
the King to publish his instructions in the Parisian press,
and all Vienna now read the edifying principles on which
the French legation proceeded. Russia and Prussia
were being gradually forced into a minority, and their
covetous designs on Poland and Saxony were being
cleverly represented as the real obstacles to progress.
Their mortification was profound. Neither social
coldness nor the refusal of information disturbed
Talleyrand’s equanimity. The one design was defeated
by the attractiveness of his establishment, the other was a
stratagem he had too often encountered. Gagern and
Castlereagh alone used to visit the Hotel Kaunitz in the
first week or two, but the amiable countess soon saw her
dinners well attended. Early in December the Austrian
papers described her as the first lady in the quadrille at a
ball of the utmost brilliance and importance. And
Talleyrand’s tongue counted for something in the
cosmopolitan society at Vienna. “His biting sarcasm
ranged all the thinkers and all the laughers on his side,”
said Metternich. His quips on the quaint manners of
the Tsar, the heavy sullenness of the Prussians, the
political innocence of the English, and the “niaiseries”
of Metternich, circulated at every ball and dinner.</p>

<p>The opening of November saw little advance in the
negotiations. Talleyrand fought resolutely for the
preservation of Saxony, against the cession of Poland to
Russia, and for the restoration of Naples to the Bourbons.
He admitted that Prussia should be indemnified,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
but “the sacred principle of legitimacy” forbade the
sacrifice of Saxony to them. When the Prussians
retorted that they would be satisfied in conscience if the
Powers assigned it to them, he replied that the Powers
could not give what did not belong to them. When
Russia tried to seize his weapon of “legitimacy” for
the defence of their design to re-establish Poland (under
the Russian crown), he blandly assented, <i>if</i> they would
re-erect the whole of Poland and make it completely
independent. And whenever a minister approached him
with a quiet suggestion of “making a bargain,” he drew
himself up with haughty moral dignity. He was
determined to get both Saxony and Naples. Throughout
October he was writing that the English ruled the
Congress, and they had “no principles.” They were
ready to give Saxony to Prussia&mdash;Castlereagh complaining
bitterly of the “treachery” of its king&mdash;and
generally to strengthen Prussia and Austria against
France; but they joined Talleyrand and Austria in
regard to Poland, and were ready to be accommodating
as regarded Naples.</p>

<p>On November 5th Metternich invited Talleyrand
to meet himself and Castlereagh. They wanted his
confidence and assistance to make some progress. The
French Minister threw up his arms. How could he
help them when he knew nothing that they did not
know, whereas they were perpetually withholding their
deliberations from him? Let them open the Congress.
He was told that the Prussians&mdash;Castlereagh told him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
privately how they dreaded him&mdash;would not hear of it
until the Powers were agreed. On the same day the
King of Prussia had a private interview with the Tsar,
and they decided to support each other. Prussia was to
have Saxony, and Russia to set up a kingdom of Poland.
Talleyrand met the agreement by impressing its inacceptable
features on Austria and England, and drawing closer
to them. By the insertion of articles in the Parisian
papers and the publication of pamphlets he was bringing
public opinion to his view as regarded Saxony. The
Austrian generals were openly in favour of it, and there
was a strong feeling for it in England. By the beginning
of December Metternich sent Talleyrand a copy of a
letter in which he protested to Prussia against the
annexation of Saxony, and “rejoiced to find himself in
line with the French Cabinet on an object so worthy of
defence.” The Tsar was losing ground daily. In spite
of his excessive amiability&mdash;he danced or took tea with
every lady in Vienna&mdash;his ambition was alarming people.
The Prussian ambassadors were seen nowhere. They
were shedding fruitless perspiration in their cabinets.
By the end of November Talleyrand reported to Louis
that France was now not only not excluded from the
settlement of questions that interested her, but was
sharing in the redistribution of Italy, Switzerland, and
Germany. Austria and England now needed her. The
perspicacious Louis solemnly accepted Talleyrand’s
assurance that it was his (the King’s) lofty enunciation
of principles which had changed the atmosphere of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
Vienna. His brief letters are full of unconscious
humour.</p>

<p>By the middle of December Talleyrand heard that
Austria, Russia, and Prussia had come to an agreement
about Poland. The Tsar relinquished his larger
pretensions, granted parts of Poland to Prussia and
Austria, and was then allowed to give the remainder a
constitution. Prussia appealed to Austria to help her to
get her much laboured compensation, and Metternich
offered her part of Poland and only a fifth part of
Saxony. This note was delivered to Talleyrand, and at
once inspired him with a fresh flow of that “noble
phraseology” which he had promised Mme. de Staël to
employ at Vienna. He ceased to speak of Poland, and
concentrated on Saxony. The King of Saxony must
be invited to say what part of his territory he would
surrender (it was now clear the whole could not be
preserved). Civilised nations know no such process as
confiscation. Castlereagh was now directed to come to
an understanding with Talleyrand. The French Minister
responded with a proposal that England, France, and
Austria should sign a convention to protect Saxony, and
in the early days of January a secret treaty between the
three was signed. Military preparations were quietly
made, and it transpired in Vienna that they had urged
the Turks to make a diversion against Russia in case of
war. A number of the secondary Powers joined them.</p>

<p>For a time the situation seemed dangerous, and the
exasperation of Prussia was great. But the defensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
character of the new alliance was discreetly emphasised,
fresh concessions of territory were made to Prussia,
and the Tsar urged a peaceful and speedy settlement.
Talleyrand wrote in glowing language to France, and he
was assured from the capital that his prestige had risen
considerably. He made a last adroit use of his indirect
diplomatic machinery before the close of the Congress.
The anniversary of the execution of Louis XVI occurred
on January 21st, and arrangements were made for an
impressive ceremony in the cathedral at Vienna, at which
few of the rulers and statesmen could decline the
invitation to assist. Every detail of it was directed
to further Talleyrand’s aims. The sermon delivered
had been prepared by the Count de Noailles&mdash;Louis
said that nothing so fine had been heard at Paris&mdash;and
Talleyrand induced Gentz to write a special account
of the ceremony in the Vienna <i>Beobachter</i>. A huge
crowd of princes and politicians dined that night at the
Hotel Kaunitz. Vienna was subtly impregnated with
sympathy.</p>

<p>The last stages of the Congress passed more swiftly
and smoothly. Prussia had to withdraw her protest
against the admission of Talleyrand to the commission
on territorial redistribution, so that the great aim of his
policy as regarded procedure was fully attained. That
he should secure the literal acceptance of his programme
in the redistribution itself was not to be expected, but
the final arrangement was widely different from what the
other Powers had intended. The kingdom of Saxony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
was preserved, though greatly reduced. On the other
hand Prussia obtained the Rhine districts, which Talleyrand
had tried to prevent her from getting on the ground
that she was “a quarrelsome neighbour.” The other
Powers were not unwilling to see her mount guard
against France on the Rhine. The smaller German
kingdoms were left in existence. Some of them had
bespoken Talleyrand’s interest. Austria obtained Venice
in spite of him, but he eventually got his way as regarded
Naples. Wellington (who replaced Castlereagh in
February) supported the French demand for the expulsion
of Murat, Russia was driven to the same conclusion
in the design of weakening Austria, and Murat finally
played into their hands by declaring for Napoleon. Thus
the two chief details of his programme, the maintenance
of a kingdom of Saxony and the restoration of Naples to
the Bourbons, were secured. His dignified refusal to
compromise had the full empirical justification which he
had expected. In other matters he was less rigid in his
cult of “principle.” He raised no protest to Bernadotte
retaining Sweden, and maintained the act of mediation in
Switzerland.</p>

<p>The Congress of Vienna is the greatest of Talleyrand’s
diplomatic achievements, and I have endeavoured
to give an outline of his methods of action there. The
results are familiar in general history. Apart from the
distinguished talent that he exhibited, and that is easily
appreciated, it only remains to say a word about his
motives. It is needless to point out that his inexorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
insistence on principle was a carefully calculated expedient.
It would be misleading to recall here his saying
that “the best principle is to have none at all.” He
had principles; but they were ultimate principles.
Peace, justice, France and humanity were ideals at which
he never scoffed. There his idealism ended. It was
one of the chief grounds of the exasperation of his
opponents that they knew how little he really cared
about principles of “legitimacy” and the like. His
action was inspired and controlled by a variety of
motives&mdash;the interest of France, the cause of European
peace, the family interests of Louis XVIII, some sense
of chivalry for the smaller States, the picturesqueness
and humour of posing as the champion of virtue
amongst the partitioning Powers, and the expectation
of gratitude from such men as the King of Saxony.
He is said to have received two, and even three, million
francs from Saxony. As usual, the statement is quite
unauthoritative, and the rumours are conflicting. The
Congress of Vienna probably brought him a very large
sum. I have pointed out before that there was no
pretence of stealth about his receiving money, though
the sums mentioned by various writers seem generally
to be guesses. Not a single instance is alleged in which
he was “bought.” Presents of money changed hands
very freely at Vienna. As it had been Talleyrand’s
deliberate policy to stand between the larger Powers
and the smaller&mdash;to prevent, as far as possible, the
growth of the former by the absorption of the latter&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
he would be in the end an exceptional recipient of
gratitude.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> He would have smiled at the notion that
this gratitude should only have been embodied in
diamonds or china, especially if it is true that at that
very moment his splendid library was being dispatched
to Sotheby’s.</p>

<p>Before the Tsar left Vienna Talleyrand was compelled
to impair still more their earlier friendship.
Alexander had shown much coolness in regard to him in
September and October. To disappointment in the
development in France was added the consciousness
that Talleyrand was strenuously opposing his Polish
plans. As time wore on, and Talleyrand’s campaign
succeeded, there was a change. By the end of
November Alexander was looking out everywhere for
Talleyrand, who avoided him. The settlement of the
Polish question left them tolerably friendly. Then
came an incident which Talleyrand must have faced with
great reluctance. He had earlier favoured the idea of
a marriage between the Archduchess Anna and the Duc
de Berry. He now felt that a Franco-Russian alliance
was undesirable, and wrote to dissuade Louis XVIII
from entertaining the project. The Tsar approached
him directly on the matter at Vienna, and he had to
suggest difficulties and have recourse to the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
transparent device of postponing the subject. The Tsar
had not forgotten how Talleyrand and he had secretly
agreed at Erfurt to deceive Napoleon in regard to the
same archduchess. It considerably widened the breach
between them.</p>

<p>Had Talleyrand foreseen the events of the coming
March he might have used more diplomacy. In the
evening of March 6th the various ministers were
urgently summoned by Metternich. Talleyrand was
the first to arrive and to hear that Napoleon had sailed
from Elba. There was excitement enough, but it is a
great exaggeration to speak of dismay. The news had
the good effect of quickening the pace at Vienna, and
there was not a moment’s hesitation on the part of the
Powers as to the steps to be taken. Napoleon was a
common enemy, a common outlaw. Talleyrand did not
believe at first that he would land in France, but he
could hardly have been unprepared for the account of
his victorious advance on Paris. For weeks he had
been receiving letters on the mutinous condition of the
army, the criminal expenditure on gold-laced household
troops, the incessant attacks on the holders of nationalised
property, and the other abuses and follies of the returned
party. Within a fortnight Napoleon was at Paris, and
the pompous and misguided Louis was flying towards
Belgium. The Powers became “allies” once more,
and set their forces in motion to arrest “the bandit.”</p>

<p>Lytton, who has done so much to clear the character
of Talleyrand from calumny, is here betrayed into an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
unfortunate error. He says that Talleyrand recollected
that the first duty of a diplomatist after a congress is to
see to his liver, and departed for Carlsbad. Sainte
Beuve and others have eagerly reproduced this picture of
the wily politician retiring into inactivity on Napoleon’s
reappearance, and waiting to see which side would win
in the struggle. The picture is totally false. The
Congress was not completed&mdash;its act was not signed&mdash;until
June 9th. Talleyrand left Vienna the very next day
for Belgium, and was in Brussels on June 21st. Further,
we have the correspondence he wrote to Louis from
Vienna, and from this it is clear, not only that he
remained at Vienna, but that he rendered most important
and loyal service to Louis throughout the Hundred
Days. There is never more than an interval of a few
days between his letters, and they are all dated from
Vienna. It is true that Von Gagern speaks of him as
asking an asylum in Wiesbaden, but there is no room
whatever to admit an absence from duty at any time of
more than a day or two. Finally, we know that he
formally rejected the advances made by Napoleon.</p>

<p>In the first few days he clearly felt no serious
concern about the movements of Napoleon. The event
might be turned to good account, he observed. He
went at once with Metternich and Wellington to see
the King of Saxony at Pressburg on behalf of the
Congress. It was left to Talleyrand chiefly to persuade
the king that he must submit, and the mission was
quickly discharged. He found an old friend of his, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
Countess de Brionne, dying at Pressburg, and interrupts
his account of the Congress to describe his touching
farewell. He could weep like a woman on such
occasions. He was back in Vienna on March 13th, and
signed on behalf of France the manifesto of the Powers
against Napoleon. It is impossible that he should have
had any serious doubt about the final issue of Napoleon’s
raid. He heard Alexander offer the whole resources of
his country, and saw the absolute unanimity and resolution
of Europe. The Treaty of Chaumont was
revived, and every State in Europe was invited to join
the grand coalition. Talleyrand secured that the French
king should now be included in the allied forces against
Napoleon.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, four days afterwards came the news
that the King had crossed the frontier with a slender
regiment of followers. Talleyrand had urged that he
should remain in one of the fortresses in the north of
France. He had written to the King on April 23rd to
tell him of the firm attitude of the Powers against
Napoleon, but had added, “with infinite regret,” that
they were less definite in their attitude towards Louis.
This was really not the case at that time, but it seemed
a good opportunity to bring the King to reason. He
followed up his point with a strong plea for reform and
Liberalism, and said he would join the King as soon as
the interests of France permitted him to leave Vienna.
A few days later he wrote that there had been an
intrigue to prevent the signature of the Act of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
Congress, and he must remain to defeat it. Then came
the very unwelcome news that Louis had fled from the
country. Talleyrand wrote to express his regret, and
hoped that the Court had brought away from Paris all his
letters from Vienna. Amongst them was a copy of the
secret treaty with Austria and England against Russia
and Prussia. Napoleon would not fail to make use of
this. Louis’s courtiers had brought away the crown
jewels and left the documents behind.</p>

<p>The Act of the Congress was not signed until June
9th, and Talleyrand resisted all entreaties to come to
Belgium until this was done. Chateaubriand wrote him
that it was “absolutely necessary” for him to come.
Talleyrand’s decision to remain at or near Vienna until
the fruits of his diplomacy were fully secured is not
open to criticism or misinterpretation. There was a real
danger in the postponement and re-opening of the
Congress. It is quite true that he was approached by
an emissary of Napoleon during April. Montrond, an
old friend of Talleyrand’s, came to Vienna to ascertain
the attitude of the Powers and make overtures to
Talleyrand. Napoleon, who had at first proscribed him,
was now anxious to secure him. Michaud declares,
with the customary absolute lack of authority, that
Talleyrand offered to negotiate for him the return of
the Empress and her son. Napoleon himself admits
that one of the objects of Montrond was to “win
Talleyrand,” and claims that “all his objects were
achieved.” The claim is frivolous. We have not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
very distinct picture of Talleyrand’s occupation during
April and May, but there is no ground whatever for
doubting the truth of his statement that he refused to
treat with Montrond. At the most we may merely
smile at his explanation that it would have “prostituted
his politics.” He saw that Europe was determined to
remove Napoleon. No doubt he had a momentary
anxiety when he learned that Napoleon had given the
Russians a copy of his secret treaty of January 3rd,
but he laughed it off to Nesselrode, and soon learned
that Alexander was unmoved by it. Once that danger
was over, the alliance against Napoleon was irresistible.</p>

<p>On the other hand there was an increasing disinclination
among the Allies to pledge themselves to
support Louis, and other alternatives were freely discussed.
We may very well admit that Talleyrand kept
an open mind on these, and would much rather be in
Austria than Belgium. But he acted loyally on behalf
of the King. It was he who induced the reluctant
Allies to send representatives to the Court at Ghent.
The most serious alternative to Louis was the Duke of
Orléans, who was at London, and in regard to whom
Talleyrand seems to have been entirely passive. It is
not unlikely that, apart from his real concern to see the
Act of the Congress signed, he wanted to see the ultra
faction entirely discredited at Ghent, and a more definite
leaning to his own liberal policy before proceeding
there. He knew how things were going on at Ghent.
The distracted King was wavering between the courtiers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
who threw the whole blame of the revolution on the
Radicals, and the Liberal statesmen who returned it to the
shoulders of the returned emigrants. The Allies were
throwing their weight in the latter side of the scale, and
were discussing the advisability of superseding Louis.
The Tsar openly favoured the Duke of Orléans. Louis
was forced to press for the return of Talleyrand, and
the signing of the act of the Congress on June 9th left
him no reason for delay in Vienna. He departed on
the following day, and arrived at Brussels on the 21st.</p>

<p>Waterloo had been fought and won. Napoleon
was now a dead force, but Louis continued to be a very
equivocal one. Acting on the unfortunate advice of
Wellington, the King was re-entering France in the
train of the allied armies. Talleyrand had urged the
more politic course of entering France independently,
and setting up the government quite apart from their
influence. He concluded that the King was again
swayed by his incompetent followers, and declined to
see him. He had proceeded to Mons, where the King
had halted, but angrily rejected the advice of the more
moderate ministers to have an interview. In the night,
however, he was awakened with the intelligence that
Louis was on the point of leaving Mons, and he hurried
across. Witnesses who scanned Talleyrand’s countenance
after the interview read contradictory expressions into it.
Chateaubriand says he was “mad with rage”; Beugnot,
a less sentimental observer, says that he was in one of
his best moods. Talleyrand probably played the Sphinx,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
but we know from him that he “made no impression”
on the King, although he spoke very plainly to him of
the divine right of kings and the human rights of
peoples.</p>

<p>He had, apparently, some presentiment of the evil
disposition of the King, and had prepared a memorandum
to be read at leisure. In this “Report” he
gave his official account of his work at Vienna, and
added a very straight talk on the situation in France.
While the principle of legitimacy was triumphing in
Vienna, he said, it was being enfeebled in France itself.
He summarises the complaints of constitutionalist
people, putting them in the mouth of observers at
Vienna. “The source of a power must not be confused
with its exercise.” “When religious sentiments were
profoundly graven on the hearts and were all-powerful
in the minds of the people, men might believe that the
power of the sovereign was an emanation of the
Divinity. To-day it is the general opinion&mdash;and it is
useless to seek to enfeeble it&mdash;that governments exist
solely for the people.” Neglect of these principles had
prepared the way for Napoleon. His memoir made no
more impression than his conversation.</p>

<p>The King would not be persuaded to follow Talleyrand’s
plan of entry into France, and proceeded to
Cambrai. Talleyrand ended by asking permission to
take the waters at Carlsbad, and the King politely
trusted they would do him good. It is useless to seek
to discover any plan in Talleyrand’s thoughts on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
day after the King left him at Mons. There was
probably none. The situation was too changeful and
precarious for such designs. He assisted at the dinner
given by the Mayor of Mons, and covered his chagrin
with more than customary charm and brilliance of
conversation. Metternich wrote to confirm him in his
attitude; but Wellington was determined to have in
France “one man they could trust,” and immediately
begged him to rejoin the King. He replied in a long
letter to Wellington, accepting his advice and enlarging
on the folly of the King in putting himself in the hands
of the extreme Royalists. There was still, he said, no
guarantee whatever of constitutional procedure, and the
whole work of the Allies might again be frustrated.
But he joined Louis “amongst the baggage of the
English army” at Cambrai, and resumed the struggle
with evil influences. Wellington now occupied the
predominant position that Alexander had held in the
Restoration of 1814. Talleyrand speaks of him at
the time with no great respect, but they later formed
an intimate friendship.</p>

<p>When Talleyrand arrived at Cambrai a Council was
called by the King. A most tactless proclamation had
been issued by the Court party, and Talleyrand now
submitted a second one to the Council. It contained
such phrases as: “My Government may have made
mistakes; possibly it has.” The King’s brother objected
that such an admission “lowered royalty” and could
not be made. When the document went on to describe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
the King as “carried away by his affections,” Monsieur
warmly requested to know if that was a reference to
himself. “Yes, it is,” said Talleyrand, “since Monsieur
has placed the discussion on that ground. Monsieur
has done a great deal of harm.” The Duc de Berry
now heatedly interposed that only the presence of the
King prevented him from resenting the use of such
language to his father. Louis stopped the quarrel, and
said that the proclamation would be altered. The
substance of it was adopted, however, and it was issued,
signed by the King and by Talleyrand.</p>

<p>They entered Paris on July 8th, and another phase
of Talleyrand’s difficulties began. Whether the Allies
would have been more moderate, or less secure in their
ground, if Louis had followed his advice and entered
France independently of them, is not quite so clear as
he would have us think. In any case the situation was
very different from what it had been in 1814. Prussia
was more determined than ever to humble France.
The Tsar was less disposed than ever to curb Blücher,
and to protect Louis. Wellington was the only one
who was thoroughly in favour of the Restoration; and
he was too little acquainted with French affairs and too
eager to take independent action to co-operate with
Talleyrand’s plans. After two months of exasperating
struggle Talleyrand was driven into retirement.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">THE “FOREIGNERS OF THE INTERIOR”</span></p>


<p>On July 9th, the day after the re-entering of Paris,
Talleyrand was appointed Foreign Minister and President
of the Council. His difficulties began with the new
Ministry. He had in June drawn up a list of ministers,
and had carefully excluded Fouché and included two
men with a view to conciliating the Tsar. But Fouché
was intrigueing most assiduously for a place in the
Ministry. The contrast between the two men is
instructive. Both have the remarkable history of taking
service under the successive governments of the country;
both were experts of the highest ability in their respective
departments. Yet while later writers have expended
a vast amount of moral indignation over the “knight
of the order of the weathercock” (as they called Talleyrand)
there has been comparatively little concern about
Fouché. While Talleyrand has been at times buried
beneath a mass of such epithets as corruption, treachery,
venality, and unscrupulousness, Fouché has been passed
by with a smile at his knavery. Nevertheless, while
Talleyrand takes his place with some dignity in the
eyes of contemporary statesmen in the successive
administrations, Fouché has to resort to the most
unblushing jobbery, and is only admitted under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
heavy pressure of practical exigencies. Nothing could
better illustrate the effort and prejudice that have been
thrown into the hostile interpretation of Talleyrand’s
career.</p>

<p>Fouché had been at work since April, when, while
serving under Napoleon, he had offered the King to get
rid of him on condition of receiving the Ministry of Police.
After Waterloo he flew from place to place, and statesman
to statesman, offering to surrender Napoleon, obtain the
capitulation of Paris&mdash;anything in order to get his coveted
place in the Ministry. He persuaded Monsieur that he
was necessary for crushing the remainder of the rebellion,
and at last imposed that view on Wellington.
Talleyrand resisted the tendency to purchase his useful
qualities, but was overruled and had to admit him as a
colleague. He is often blamed for not resigning at
once. No doubt he tested that suggestion by his usual
question: “What good would it do?” It is difficult
to see any real ground for censuring him. He strongly
blames Wellington for admitting Fouché, and suggests
that he was too eager “to be the first to enter Paris.”
Chateaubriand was in attendance on the King at
St. Denis, and saw Talleyrand come from his chamber
leaning on Fouché&mdash;“vice leaning on the arm of
crime,” he bitterly says. It was Chateaubriand above
all who had implored Talleyrand to come from Vienna
to the assistance of the King.</p>

<p>Talleyrand was further disappointed in forming the
new Ministry by being unable to include the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
friends of the Tsar. Pozzo di Borgo preferred to
remain in the service of Russia. The Duc de Richelieu
replied that he had been twenty years out of France,
and was quite incompetent to take a responsible position
in the conduct of the affairs of the country. Talleyrand
seems to have known that the Tsar was pressing for
Richelieu to replace himself, and he sent a rather
sarcastic reply. When Richelieu did actually replace
him at the head of the Ministry two months afterwards,
he took the mild revenge of inserting a copy of his
letter (pleading incompetence for a minor position) in
his memoirs, and issuing a <i>mot</i> on the subject.
Someone asked him if he really thought Richelieu
capable of taking the head of French affairs. “Of
course;” he said, “no one in France knows so much
about the Crimea as he does.”</p>

<p>The next step was to nominate the prefects of departments.
The most competent men were Napoleonists,
and could not be reinstated. On the other hand the
Court party were pressing upon the King a host of
totally incompetent men on the plea that they were
faithful Royalists. To have been in Ghent became the
first qualification for office. When one man urged his
claim on Talleyrand in this way he asked: “Are you
sure you <i>went</i> to Ghent, and have not merely returned
from there.” The man was naturally puzzled. “Because,
you see,” Talleyrand continued, “there were only seven
or eight hundred of us there, and to my knowledge
seventy or eighty thousand have <i>come</i> from there.” But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
he had to witness the appointment of hundreds of these
incapable Royalists, while the state of the provinces
demanded firm and competent administrators. Between
the excesses of the allied troops and the conflicts of
Royalists and Bonapartists there were sanguinary disturbances.
One advantage was gained indirectly. Fouché
had to draw up a report on the troubles for the King,
and he published this before submitting it to his
colleagues. He pretended it had been stolen from
him, but Talleyrand demanded his expulsion from the
Ministry, and the King assented (September 19th). The
mythologists give this as the last dialogue of the two
ministers. “So you are dismissing me, you scoundrel.”
“Yes, you imbecile.”</p>

<p>Meantime there were a score of other distractions.
The conduct of the allied troops was so exasperating
and oppressive that the King directed him to make a
formal protest. The Allies demanded guarantees of
peace, and a long and irritating correspondence ensued.
On the other hand the ultras were making every effort
to restore the vicious features of the old regime, in
absolute blindness to the history of the Hundred Days;
or, indeed, on the plea that greater “firmness” in 1814
would have prevented Napoleon’s raid. Talleyrand was
sorely tried. “With infinite trouble,” he says, he
succeeded in maintaining a certain degree of liberty for
the Press. He had then to combat the demand for the
punishment of those who had sided with Napoleon. He
pleaded that it was enough to depose the senators who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
had offended, but a list of a hundred names for
proscription had been prepared by the obsequious
Fouché. After a struggle of several days Talleyrand
got the list reduced to fifty-seven names. He also
warned a large number of those who were to be
brought to trial, and gave passports and money freely
so that they might leave the country. He dispensed
459,000 francs in this way. Moreover, when the King
went on to create the new peers, he prevailed on him
to include a few of the names of those who had joined
Napoleon.</p>

<p>Nor were Talleyrand’s difficulties with the Allies
themselves less considerable. Immediately after the
entry into Paris Blücher had promised himself the
pleasure of blowing up the Pont Jena, a fine new bridge
over the river. His whole conduct was vindictive. He
had quartered his troops in the Place de Carrousel, with
the guns pointing on the gates of the Tuileries. He had
already mined two arches of the bridge when the King
heard, and wrote to Talleyrand that if the threat were
carried out he would have himself taken to the bridge
and blown up with it. Talleyrand at once dispatched
Beugnot to “use the strongest language at his command”
to Blücher. Beugnot wanted to quote the King’s letter,
but Talleyrand said the Prussians “would not believe
we are so heroic as that.” Blücher was quickly discovered
at his favourite gaming-room (No. 113, Palais Royal),
and was pacified with a promise that the name of the
bridge would be changed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span></p>

<p>Talleyrand was less successful in his resistance to
the Allies when they claimed the statues and pictures
and other works of art that had been brought to Paris.
On September 11th Castlereagh wrote him that the
Pope, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, the King of the
Netherlands, King of Prussia, and others demanded
the return of their treasures, and the Allies had decided
to comply. Talleyrand at once protested in the sacred
name of morality against such a spoliation of the Parisian
museums. At least, he concluded, this should have
been done in 1814 or not at all. Wellington now took
up the argument, and cut him short “with the brutality
of a soldier.” The phrase is scarcely too strong. The
Duke’s letter terminated: “The sovereigns were unable
to wrong their subjects in order to satisfy the pride of
the French army and nation, who must be made to feel
that, in spite of a few temporary and partial advantages
in various States, the day of restitution had come, and
the allied monarchs could not neglect this opportunity
of giving the French a great lesson in morality!”
Talleyrand observes in the memoirs that no doubt
Wellington had equally espoused the cause of morality
when he had been on service in India.</p>

<p>And through all these troubles and distractions
there was the grave anxiety about the new terms to be
offered to France by the Allies. Pasquier would have
us believe that during these busy months Talleyrand
was peculiarly indolent, and that his whole energy was
absorbed in fretting over a certain lady who seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
inclined to desert him.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> But the whole of Pasquier’s
narrative at this period is tinged with bitterness against
Talleyrand, and must not lightly be followed. He is
too obviously trying to justify the change from Talleyrand
to his friend Richelieu. However much he may have
betrayed his concern at the obstinate absence from Paris
of his friend, it is, on the face of it, absurd to say that
he could think of nothing else. We have seen that he
had plenty to do, and did it. If it is true that there
was a notable lack of the intense energy he usually
displayed at critical periods (as Casimir Périer says), it
is surely possible to trace this to the profound weariness
and disgust that the whole situation would inspire.
Feebly supported by the King, hated and maligned by
the courtiers, surrounded by the intrigues of the
Richelieus and Pasquiers and Fouchés, confronted with
the hostility of Prussia and Russia and annoyed by the
blunders of Wellington, conscious of the wretched state
of the country and of the determination of the Allies to
undo their generosity of 1814 and avenge Vienna,
convinced that he himself would soon be cast aside as a
worn-out tool, he had cause enough for weariness.</p>

<p>During the whole of August and the early part of
September the Allies had succeeded in wrapping their
deliberations in a secrecy which he could not penetrate.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>About the middle of September he learned their terms,
and they were presented a few days later in “a sort of
ultimatum.” They themselves summarised their intentions
pointedly enough in the clause: “Two-thirds of
the territory added to the France of former days by the
Treaty of Paris will now be detached from it.” In
addition, France was to pay an indemnity of 600,000,000
francs, provide 200,000,000 to build fortresses against
herself in the provinces adjoining her frontiers, and
maintain a foreign army of 150,000 men along her
frontiers for seven years as a guarantee of peace. Prussia
had triumphed. The English Ministers had wished to
moderate the terms, but even they were shaken when it
was pointed out that the Netherlands must be strengthened
against France. Talleyrand, who rightly or wrongly
believed that the whole of these harsh proceedings of
the Allies would have been prevented if Louis had
followed his advice at Mons, made a last effort to resist.
The Council agreed with him in rejecting the terms, and
he wrote a long and very able statement of his objections.
He fell back on the bases of his policy as laid at Vienna.
Conquest did not, in modern life, constitute a moral
right to confiscation; moreover, Louis had been expressly
admitted as one of the Allies against Napoleon. France
was prepared to make sacrifices in return for the sacrifices
of the other Powers, but he would not continue the
negotiations if these exorbitant demands were pressed.</p>

<p>Castlereagh, who is severely censured by Lytton for
joining in these harsh claims, replied that the Allies made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
no pretence whatever to a right given by conquest. The
whole base of their claims was the right to indemnity
and to a territorial settlement that gave Europe some
guarantee of stability. Some of the foreign representatives
were pressing for a special notice of the
defiant conclusion of Talleyrand’s letter, but he decided
to resign. Louis was prepared to yield; he had no
army with which to threaten resistance, and it was clear
that Talleyrand’s diplomatic talent would now avail him
nothing. Talleyrand explains that his position was
weakened by the fact that some of the King’s entourage
were all along in favour of a cession of territory, and
that during the Hundred Days the Chamber of Representatives
had already made the offer. He was, therefore,
unable to press his last plea that the country would
not endure such terms. He resigned his post on
September 23rd, rather than sign the treaty. Metternich,
Castlereagh and Stewart begged him to continue to be
“a statesman of Europe,” and Pasquier admits that
almost all the Foreign Ministers deeply regretted his
retirement, though he confesses that he himself did not
share that feeling. The Tsar was pleased. His favourite,
the Duc de Richelieu, was substituted for Talleyrand.
Louis accepted his resignation with a mingled feeling of
apprehension and relief. “I thank you for your zeal,”
he said to Talleyrand before the whole Cabinet; “you
are without reproach, and nothing prevents you from
living peacefully at Paris.” Talleyrand replied: “I
have had the pleasure of rendering to the King services<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
enough to believe that they have not been forgotten. I
am unable to see how anything could force me to leave
Paris. I shall stay here; and I shall be happy to learn
that the King will not be induced to follow a line that
may compromise his dynasty and France.”</p>

<p>Napoleon had not been very wide of the mark
when he said in 1814 that the Bourbons would avenge
him by throwing over Talleyrand within six months. It
did not, however, require any great penetration to foresee
such an issue. The personality of the King and of
his entourage furnished solid ground for prophecy. The
curious evolution of the Tsar into a friend of Louis and
enemy of Talleyrand, and his resumption of a great
influence on French affairs, made further for estrangement;
and when the first elections under the Restoration
gave the power to the ultra-royalist faction in the
country, the situation was complete. Talleyrand retired
to write his impressions of men and events. Louis
provided for him the sinecure of High Chamberlain
at 100,000 francs a year, and a further pension of 16,000
francs. He did not foresee that Talleyrand would take
a conscientious view of his new duties, and would haunt
his chair, a silent, smiling Mephistopheles, for years to
come.</p>

<p>Talleyrand probably felt that the King would be
forced to recall him in time. For the moment he betook
himself to the writing of the famous memoirs which
were to sustain the legend of his inscrutability until the
close of the nineteenth century. It is probable that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
had written the material for the first volume (up to
1809) already. In this he gives a prosaic and brief
account of his first fifty years, with lively and artistic
pictures of some of his great fellow actors (especially
the Duc d’Orléans), and with a very discreet and
unboastful account of his share in the Revolution. The
second volume and half of the third carry the story up
to the middle of 1814. The rest of the work consists
almost entirely of his correspondence from Vienna,
during the second Restoration, and from London under
Louis Philippe; the letters being scantily threaded on a
brief and common-place narrative. The close of the
narrative at his retirement from the Ministry is dated
“Valençay, 1816.” The rest was compiled in the last
three years of his life. He took stringent precautions
that they should not be published until thirty years
after his death, and not even then if those to whom
they were entrusted thought fit to postpone the publication.
It was, in fact, decided in 1868 to refrain from
issuing them for another generation, and they only
appeared in 1891. From one end of Europe to the
other there was an expression of profound disappointment
when they appeared. Such stringent measures
had promised stirring revelations, but the volumes
contained absolutely no sensational matter and very little
that was new to historians.</p>

<p>There is very little of the “apologia” in the
memoirs, and not much of the impulse that urged
most of his contemporaries to cover reams of paper with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
their contradictory versions of history. He is usually
content to let documents tell the story. But, though
Talleyrand ignores most of the charges that were made
against him, he naturally reviews history in a light that
sets his own career in harmony. Lady Blennerhassett
surmises that his chief object when he wrote in 1816 was
to conciliate Louis XVIII, and prepare the way for a
return to power. Lord Acton has expressed the same
opinion. It is based on the dexterous presentation of
the way in which he was forced into the Revolution,
the brevity with which he dismisses the more offensive
parts of his share in it, his explanation of Napoleon as a
step towards the Restoration, and the fulness of his
account of his share in the Restoration and the work at
Vienna. But this theory has to struggle desperately
with the fact that his precautions against the publications
of the memoirs before the appointed time were
absolute, and must have been sincere. Nothing would
have been easier for a man like Talleyrand than to have
secured an accidental disclosure or theft of his papers;
and the fact that he used to read passages from them to
a few of his friends does not further his supposed plan
in the slightest degree. Ordinary conversation with
them would do just as well. On the other hand, we
can quite understand the air of progressive policy he
gives to his career by merely assuming that he wished
to make it appear consistent. A statesman who was
convinced that monarchy was the best form of government
for France, and who, nevertheless, took a purely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
rationalist and utilitarian view of monarchy, would deal
just in that way with his share in the Revolution and the
Napoleonic era. It was a minor comfort to the epicurean
to leave a rounded version of his life to posterity.</p>

<p>The literary aspect of the memoirs may be
briefly dismissed. Their authenticity is now beyond
dispute, but it is acknowledged that Talleyrand did not
write the connected narrative. He had the habit of
jotting down his ideas on scraps of paper, and leaving
it to his secretaries to weave them together. This was
done by M. Bacourt with the memoirs. M. Pierre
Bertrand has, in his preface to the “Lettres inédites
de Talleyrand à Napoleon,” sufficiently disposed of the
insinuation that Talleyrand could not write. By comparison
of the Prince’s notes with the secretary’s drafts
and the finished letters he has shown that Talleyrand
counted for far more than was supposed in the composition.
He might have shown, by internal evidence, that
many of the letters were wholly written by Talleyrand.
However, we know that Talleyrand dictated letters, or
left it to his secretaries to compose them, whenever it
was safe to do so. It was a sound economy; and it
was not unconnected with his heavy foot-gear, which
led him to prefer the couch to sitting at a table. Of
the literary quality of his writing there is not much to
be said. He could do “fine writing” at times, as
Sainte-Beuve said; and Lord Acton admits that much
of the characterisation in the memoirs is very clever.
But the bulk of the work is without distinction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span></p>

<p>Talleyrand’s position in Paris during the year after
his resignation was a curious one. The Hotel St.
Florentin continued to be a resort of the most distinguished
foreigners and many of the ablest French
politicians, but the strange conflicts of the time put the
Prince (Benevento had returned to the Papacy, but he
had now a French title) in a peculiar attitude. The
King and the Cabinet were now engaged in a struggle
to defend constitutional monarchy against the excesses
of the extreme Royalists. Talleyrand claimed to be
at once “constitutional and anti-ministerial.” The
positive ground for this attitude was that the King had
annulled the elections and ordered fresh ones, to give
the Liberals the chance of undoing the triumph of the
reactionaries. As a result of this novel situation
Talleyrand found himself using almost the same
language as his bitterest Royalist enemies, and declaiming
against “a Cabinet that enslaved and degraded France.”
It is quite clear that there was an element of calculation
and of prejudice in his position. His opposition
became so exasperating that the King forbade him to
come to the Court for some months.</p>

<p>After this we have a period of four years of political
silence. Indeed, only three incidents call for our notice
during the next fourteen years. He resigned himself
once more to the position of a mere spectator, and was
content to throw a light jet of sarcasm on the panorama
that passed before him. English visitors to Paris, who
eagerly sought to enter the Hotel St. Florentin, describe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
him sitting in his favourite chair by the open window in
the summer, looking across to the Tuileries. The long
and luxuriant hair now bore the snow of more than sixty
winters, but was curled and perfumed every morning
with no less care than when he was the Abbé de Périgord.
The bluish shade had passed from his grey eyes, and as
age wore on his eyelids drooped more and more, so that
he seemed at times to sleep during conversation. But
when the moment came the old fire would flash from
under his shaggy eye-brows, and his sepulchral voice
would give forth a phrase that would reverberate through
all the salons of Paris. The freshness and transparency
of his younger complexion gave place in time to a death-like
greyness. Lady Morgan, who saw him at this
period, said his face was like that of a sleeping child. It
was a superficial tribute to the art of the two valets who
spent hours in preparing it every day. Most visitors
who visited him at his hotel, or met him in the picture
galleries, leaning heavily on his long stick, dressed in his
long blue overcoat, and with his chin sunk in his large
muslin cravat, thought they saw the face of a dead or
dying man, or a piece of yellow wax-work&mdash;until his eye
pierced them.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="caption">TALLEYRAND<br />

(Under Louis XVIII.).</p></div>



<p>His temperate habits had spared his health and
energy. In the later years he would rise about eleven,
spend two or three hours in leisurely dressing and
chatting to privileged visitors, take only one meal a
day, and spend the evening&mdash;and far into the morning&mdash;in
whist or billiards or conversation or writing. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>had four head cooks, each the best in his department,
but most observers agree that he ate sparingly, and at
no time of his career sinned against his epicureanism by
excessive drinking. A few glasses of choice Madeira
sufficed him. He drank, or rather enjoyed, exquisite
coffee, and loved to have sweet and subtle odours about
him, and to move or sit amongst rare china or books and
fine inlaid furniture. He never slept much. He maintained
to the end of his days that his constitution took
its rest while he was awake. His heart used to stand
still, as it were, after every few beats, and he formed the
theory that this was as beneficial as sleep.</p>

<p>Mme. Talleyrand had separated from him in 1815.
The new regime would have points enough in his
person to fix upon without being constantly reminded
that he was that unutterable thing, “a married priest.”
He made an arrangement by which she was to remain
in England, and receive from him a pension of 60,000
francs a year. He corresponded with her for some
time, but she gradually dropped out of his life. Once
it was being laughingly told in Paris how she had come
back in spite of her arrangement with him, and Louis
incautiously asked him if this was true. “Yes, Sire,”
he replied. “I also have had to have my 20th of
March” (the date of the King’s flight from Napoleon).
She died in Paris in 1835. Talleyrand made constant
inquiries of her in the last illness.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Courland seems to pass out of
his life after 1815. But her daughter, Dorothy, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
Duchess of Dino, took her place, and they remained
strongly attached until his death. She separated from
her husband (his nephew), and lived with or near
Talleyrand. As beautiful, charming, and accomplished
as her mother, she brought great comfort to his later
years. Her little daughter Pauline was another ray of
sunshine in the last grey winter days.</p>

<p>Most of his time during the fourteen years of
waiting for his next piece of work was spent at Valençay.
Visitors from England were familiar with the large
mansion with the broad Moorish towers, the round
domes, and the gilt weathercocks, that broke on one at
the head of the long chestnut avenue. Here, with a
large park in which he could take his drives, he would
retire for months together, and entertain large numbers
of visitors from Paris or from England. It is worth
noting that he was an exceptionally kind and generous
master. A fine lady who saw a servant accidentally
upset him in his bath-chair one day expressed a hope to
a higher domestic that the Prince would get rid of him.
“Monsieur is not a Russian prince,” was the reply.
A good servant was well cared for by him long after
his power of service was exhausted. It is necessary to
urge these small points. So many people still fail to
understand what epicureanism is.</p>

<p>In 1821 Royer-Collard the Puritan philosopher and
Liberal statesman came to live within a few leagues of
Valençay. Talleyrand at once decided to lay diplomatic
siege to Chateaux Vieux and secure an interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
neighbour. The moralist is said to have been uneasy
at Talleyrand’s proposal to visit him, and pleaded his
wife’s illness and other excuses. Talleyrand drove over,
nevertheless, with his graceful auxiliary, the Duchess.
Chateaux Vieux was built on the summit of a slight hill,
and was approached through a wild and rough country.
“My dear sir,” said Talleyrand when he reached the
house, “you present a rather austere aspect to visitors.”
The Stoic was, however, disabused of his hearsay
notion of Talleyrand, and became an intimate and
cordial friend. Sainte-Beuve says that as Talleyrand
was now in his eightieth year (he should have said
seventieth), and virtue was still his <i>côté faible</i>, he wanted
to strengthen it with the moralist and prepare for the
later confessor. If we suppose that Talleyrand desired
to avail himself for ordinary social purposes of a cultured
neighbour it seems to meet the case.</p>

<p>He built a second country-house, at Rochecotte,
on the Loire, about seven leagues from Saumur.
Though he gave this mansion to the Duchess, it was his
favourite residence. It was built on a verdant hill by
the river, and the road led up through a fine garden,
cut in the side of the hill, to the creeper-covered house.
He had a large and rich library here also, and a beautiful
collection of the art-treasures he loved to see about
him. Japanese porcelain, Medici vases, Buhl cabinets,
and other costly objects filled the rooms. Here, in
later years, he often entertained the rising young men
of France&mdash;Thiers, Villemain, De Broglie, &amp;c.&mdash;as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
as his older friends. But he saw the latter pass one by
one into the silence, and he marked off their ages with
a smile of satisfaction at his own health and vigour.</p>

<p>Paris was growing accustomed to regard him as a
picturesque survival of the wonderful past. He has
very little share in its active life during those long
years. At first he persisted in discharging his nominal
duties as Chamberlain, standing in silence behind the
King’s chair at dinner, and so on. This was a dignity
that Louis did not entirely appreciate. There is a story
that he made many efforts to get rid of Talleyrand
without success. After asking Talleyrand several times
whether it was not true that he contemplated retiring to
Valençay, and receiving bland assurances that it was
not, he at last ventured to ask how far it was to
Valençay. “I am not sure,” Talleyrand is described as
saying; “but I should think it is as far again as from
here to Ghent.” The story-teller says that Louis
dropped no more hints on that subject. There is
another Ghent story that is said to have annoyed Louis.
A lady was complaining to Talleyrand that the King
was not Royalist enough. “Why,” he said, “he was
at Ghent, and is ready to go again.”</p>

<p>There are, as I said, only two interventions in public
affairs during these fourteen years. In 1820 the Prince
thought he was on the point of re-entering politics, and
he projected a Ministry, but he was not invited to form
one. The new Ministry introduced in the following
year a law for the censorship of the press, and Talleyrand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
rose to oppose it in the House of Peers. He made a
long and stirring appeal for the liberty of the press,
which he described as “one of the essential instruments
of representative government.” Boldly defending the
better elements of the Revolution and the philosophers
who prepared the way for it, he threatened the
reactionaries with the force of public opinion. “Today,”
he said, “it is not easy to deceive for long.
There is someone who has more intelligence than
Voltaire, more intelligence than Bonaparte, more than
the Directors or any Minister, past, present, or to come&mdash;that
is, everybody.” The feeling is unmistakeably
sincere. Through the Napoleonic and Bourbonien
phases he has returned substantially to the position of
1789. In 1800 he had smiled at Napoleon’s treatment
of the press. Experience had brought him back to
moderate democracy.</p>

<p>Two years later he again protested against the
action of the Government. When the Revolution had
swept away the throne in Spain, the Royalist interest in
France determined to intervene and restore it. Talleyrand
had not an opportunity of delivering his speech,
but he had it published and made some impression. He
recalled Napoleon’s unhappy intervention, and predicted
that the present raid, which he described as equally
immoral, would end as disastrously. He was wrong in
his prophecy, but undoubtedly right in his protest. His
manifesto reveals on another side the maturing of his
liberal and humanitarian views.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span></p>

<p>In 1829 an incident occurred that has furnished his
critics with the last of their graver charges against
him&mdash;if we except his “desertion” of Charles X. On
January 21st he was present at the mass in Notre
Dame in commemoration of the death of Louis XVI.
Suddenly a man sprang from the crowd, and felled the
aged prince to the ground with a heavy blow on the
face. This man was that famous Marquis de Maubreuil,
whose adventures have lately been presented by Mr.
Vizetelly. He had adopted this brutal means of bringing
a grievance before the public. His story was that
Talleyrand had engaged him in 1814 to assassinate
Napoleon, and had afterwards disowned the contract.
For serious and impartial readers it is enough to learn
the character of this unprincipled adventurer. It is
clear that he did in 1814 obtain some kind of secret
mission, money, and a passport from the provisional
government. Talleyrand says that a large number of
men were needed for missions in the provinces, and
in the stress and confusion of the time there was not a
strict discrimination. At all events Maubreuil left Paris
with an armed company and regular passports. In the
forest of Fontainebleau he overtook the Queen of
Westphalia, who was flying from France. Maubreuil
stopped her equipage, ransacked her luggage, and made
off with her jewellery and a considerable sum of money.
He was caught and sentenced to five years’ imprisonment
in 1818, but escaped to England, where he had a fine
market for his stories. He returned to France in 1827,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>and drew public attention by his attack on Talleyrand,
then in his seventy-third year. I will only add that,
after serving five years for the assault, he, at the age of
eighty-three, married a prostitute (the daughter of his
former coachman) for the sake of her money.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="caption">CHARLES X.</p></div>



<p>Serious history would not listen for a second to
the unsupported word of such a man. The life of
Talleyrand lies on a peculiar plane, and Maubreuil’s
accusation, that he engaged him to murder Napoleon,
has been treated with the usual hypocritical gravity.
The only attempt at confirmation is found by the
diligent Sainte-Beuve in a floating rumour that one of
Talleyrand’s confidants was heard to ask: “How many
millions do you ask?” As Maubreuil did not pretend
to have treated with either Louis or De Pradt, and as
the likelihood of such a contract being heard by others
is inconceivable, the rumour would be worth little even
if it were better grounded. The only other attempt at
confirmation is made by the amiable Pasquier, who says
that Dalberg told him men had been found who would
get access to the Emperor in the uniform of chasseurs
of the guard and do away with him. As Maubreuil
spoke of a design of using this uniform, Pasquier
concluded he was the proposed leader of the band, and
Talleyrand the instigator. On this kind of evidence
Sainte-Beuve is vaguely sure that we may connect
Talleyrand with the idea of assassination, just as he has
a “terrible doubt” whether we may not connect him
with the death of Mirabeau. Thus has the mythical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
Talleyrand been put together. There are those who,
in such a case, would take the word of Maubreuil
himself, quite apart from the thin rumour that Sainte-Beuve
has captured after it has floated about Paris for
half a century, and the strained recollections of
Pasquier.</p>

<p>“I am,” said Talleyrand, “an old umbrella on
which the rain has beaten for forty years: a drop more
or less makes no difference.” He continued to watch
from his long chair at the window over the Tuileries,
and smile at the blunders that were hurrying the
Bourbons off the stage once more. Napoleon had gone
in 1821. “It is not an event,” he said; “only a piece
of news.” Louis died in 1824. The pious and narrow-minded
Charles X was in the hands of the Clerical
party. They readmitted the Jesuits in thin disguise.
“M. Cuvier,” asked Talleyrand of the great zoologist,
“which are the most grateful animals?” Cuvier was
puzzled. “The turkeys, of course,” said the Prince,
“because the Jesuits introduced the turkeys, and now
the turkeys (<i>Anglice</i>, geese) are re-introducing the
Jesuits.” Someone told him that Chateaubriand was
getting deaf. “He fancies he’s deaf,” said Talleyrand,
“because he does not hear people talking about him
any longer.” At last the crisis came, and the king-maker
stepped into public life once more.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">THE LAST ACT</span></p>


<p>Talleyrand had acquired through his long experience
a sense of political equilibrium. Men of science point
out to us in lowly marine organisms a little vesicle filled
with fluid and containing a little stone. It is the organ
by which they feel that they are ascending or descending.
In some such way Talleyrand <i>felt</i> the motion when the
governing power had begun to descend a slope. In
the later twenties he knew, as many did, that Charles X
was moving towards the abyss into which he had seen
so many plunge. The King was too narrowly Catholic
to love Talleyrand, and, though their relation was
amiable enough during the Martignac Ministry, Talleyrand’s
house became once more the centre of the
opposition. All the older Liberals and a large number
of the younger men used to gather about his couch in
the morning, or fill his rooms in the evening from
eleven to one. The Martignac Ministry was the last
effort to stem the tide of reaction. But Charles X was
quietly hostile to its enlightened policy, and he dismissed
it at the first check. On August 8th (1829) he bade
the Prince de Polignac, a man of his own views, form a
Clerical ministry. Talleyrand left Paris for Rochecotte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
in the interest of his health. It was said in Paris that,
as when Napoleon set out for Russia, he had declared it
“the beginning of the end.”</p>

<p>At Rochecotte he was visited by Molé, Sebastiani,
de Broglie, Villemain, and numbers of other politicians.
Thiers also was there, but Talleyrand regarded him
rather as a promising writer than a politician. There
was no plotting at Rochecotte. It was unnecessary.
While Polignac was receiving directions from the Virgin
Mary in visions for the governing of France, Liberal
leagues were being organised everywhere, and the
second revolution was preparing. “A thousand sinister
rumours are circulating in the capital,” said an orator
from the tribune. In March (1830) Roger Collard
presented to the King an address, voted by the Chamber
and drawn up by Guizot and himself. The King replied
by proroguing the Chamber until September. “So you
have decided on prorogation,” said Talleyrand to one of
the ministers. “Well, I think I shall buy a little
property in Switzerland.” Charles X declared he would
make no concessions. Weakness had destroyed Louis
XVI; “for my part I have no alternative but the
throne or the scaffold.” “He forgets the post-chaise,”
said Talleyrand.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus_409.jpg" width="400" height="546" alt="" />
<p class="caption">LOUIS PHILIPPE, KING OF THE FRENCH.</p></div>



<p>In May Talleyrand was back at Rochecotte, tending
his peaches and flowers as he loved to do, and discussing
the situation with Thiers, Mignet, and others. The
elections had gone heavily against the ministers. On
June 11th he wrote to the Princess de Vaudemont that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>“the decisive moment was at hand.” On the 14th he
wrote to Barante, “We are moving onward towards an
unknown world, without pilot or compass: the only
certain thing is that it will all end in shipwreck.”
Although he had certainly discussed the change from
Bourbons to Orleanists with his friends, he was really in
a state of great concern and anxiety. It was not at all
certain that they would be consulted as to the future.
The excesses of the Clerical and Royalist party had so
deeply moved the country that a bloody rebellion and
mob-triumph was possible. In July he was back at
Paris. On the 26th appeared the royal ordinances that
would destroy the liberty of the press, dissolve the
Chamber, and manipulate the elections. On the following
day he saw the troops marching to destroy the
machines of the rebellious printers, and the first barricades
raised in their path. It is said that he had the
large golden sign, “Hotel Talleyrand,” taken down from
over the gate of his house. His darkest recollections
of 1792 were revived. On the morning of the 28th
the streets of Paris were found to be cut everywhere
with barricades. The tricolour floated from the roof of
the Hotel de Ville and Notre Dame.</p>

<p>The long days of the 28th and 29th were spent
in great anxiety. His secretary (or that extremely
imaginative person who has dressed up and expounded
Colmache’s “Recollections”) says that when the tocsin
rang out on the morning of the 28th the Prince
exclaimed: “Hark! We triumph.” When the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
asked <i>who</i> triumphed, he is said to have answered:
“Hush! I will tell you to-morrow.” On the 29th
he tried to induce the peers to take a definite line, but
they were too timid. On the 30th the rumour spread
that the King had fled from St. Cloud. He sent his
secretary to make inquiries at the palace, and heard that
it was so. He then sent Colmache with a note, to be
burned in the secretary’s presence or returned to him,
to the sister of the Duc d’Orléans, Mme. Adélaide, who
was at Neuilly with the Duke. The note merely said:
“Madame may have full confidence in the bearer, who
is my secretary.” The secretary was instructed to tell
her that the Duke must come to Paris and call himself
Lieutenant-General of the kingdom&mdash;“the rest will
follow.” Before night the Duke was at the Palais
Royal. Charles X had withdrawn his inspired ordinances
at three o’clock that afternoon, but it was too late. The
Republicans were gradually controlled, and the Duke of
Orleans was accepted as the head of the State.</p>

<p>This was Talleyrand’s share in the second Revolution,
and the fifth change of government in France
during his career. He took his last oath of loyalty
without hesitation. Speaking once to an Imperialist
who distrusted him, he said: “I have never kept fealty
to anyone when he has himself ceased to obey the
dictates of common sense. If you will judge all my
actions by this rule you will find that I have been
eminently consistent.” Certainly, there is no serious
need of justifying his conduct in 1830. He had plainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
told Louis XVIII the conditions on which the Bourbons
were reinstated. “Governments exist to-day solely
for the people.” Louis and his friends had tried to
reverse the principle. Charles X had thought government
a branch of the Church.</p>

<p>Talleyrand’s restoration to public affairs was a
matter of course. Louis-Philippe offered him the
Foreign Ministry, but he felt that the embassy at
London would be at once less onerous and more
important. Once more Talleyrand’s bias towards
England proved its soundness. They agreed that
London must be made the pivot of France’s foreign
policy. Austria, Russia, and Prussia looked with little
favour on the new outburst of French revolutionary
ardour, or on the monarchy it had set up on deliberate
utilitarian grounds. The best guarantee for the
preservation of peace was to convince and draw close
to England. Here, again, where the principles on which
the throne of Louis-Philippe was raised should be familiar
enough, there was (apart from the trouble that supervened
in Belgium) a very natural tendency to view the
outburst with alarm. Wellington had said in 1815,
when the Duke of Orléans was proposed for the French
throne, that he would be “merely a well-bred usurper.”
What would he say now? The instability of Louis-Philippe’s
first ministry and the propagandist expressions
of the revolutionaries at Paris made the situation more
difficult. It was decided that Talleyrand would be most
useful at London. He received a very amiable reply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
from Lord Aberdeen (then Foreign Minister) to the
announcement of his appointment, and left Paris on
September 22nd, and reached “beautiful England, so
rich, so peaceful,” a few days later. The cannonade at
Dover that welcomed his arrival reminded him of the
day when he had last quitted the country under an
ignominious order of expulsion.</p>

<p>There were many sources of opposition to Talleyrand’s
mission, and he was at first exposed to great
annoyance. Caricatures in Piccadilly shops represented
him as a cripple leading the blindfolded Kings of
Europe, or as a trainer leading a monkey dressed in the
livery of the new French monarchy. In society he had
to face a good deal of prejudice against the new regime.
He had his own way of answering it. “Say what you
like,” the Russian Ambassador’s wife once said in his
presence, “what has taken place in France is a flagrant
usurpation.” “You are quite right, madame,” he
replied. “Only it is to be regretted it did not take
place fifteen years ago when your master, Alexander,
desired it.” The Princess Lieven afterwards became
friendly. On the other hand he was well received by
Aberdeen and cordially welcomed by Wellington and
his older friends.</p>

<p>The personnel of his embassy was not impressive,
he himself admits. In the obituary notice of him a
few years later in the <i>Morning Post</i>, he is described as
receiving visitors in his salon with a high hat and a huge
tricolour rosette on it, while three young sansculottists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
lounged with revolutionary freedom on the couch. This
was an echo of the hostility of 1830. Talleyrand had
always been strongly opposed to the obtrusion of French
revolutionary feelings at other courts or capitals, and is
not likely to have furnished the slightest ground for this
gibe over his coffin. He had brought the Duchess de
Dino with him, and this relieved the character of his
mission. Such productions of the time as “Raikes’
Journal” indicate how prominent and distinguished a
place he at once took up in the country. In fact the
writer in the <i>Morning Post</i> himself says that in time
Palmerston was almost the only man to stand conspicuously
aloof from the aged Prince, and speak of
him disdainfully as “old Tally.”</p>

<p>The great issue that complicated his work at
London was the revolt of Belgium against the Dutch.
Talleyrand had looked forward to the not uncongenial
task of introducing the new monarchy into the respectable
society of the older ones in Europe by prevailing on
England to espouse its cause. Knowing well the pacific
feeling of Louis-Philippe and his political integrity, he
had every reason to hope for success in this without
more than an easy and cheerful use of his own
accomplishments. Aristocratic feeling even in England
was suspicious and reserved. He would disarm it, and
place in the hands of the French Foreign Office the
strong card of England’s friendship. Unfortunately for
his peace, the spirit of the Revolution spread immediately
into Belgium, and the Dutch were gradually driven out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
of the country. It was England especially that had
created this joint kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815,
and she now looked with concern on what seemed to be
an attempt of France to regain the control of Belgium.</p>

<p>The news from France increased the difficulty.
There was a strong and loud demand at Paris for the
annexation of the rich, and largely French, provinces of
Belgium, and this was echoed by a considerable party
at Brussels. So powerful was the feeling and so moving
the temptation, that the French Cabinet itself inclined
to it and the King hesitated. From the end of October
until the end of February Talleyrand had to fight the
whole of Paris, as well as allay anxiety at London. But
he was convinced that a general war would ensue if
France directly or indirectly recovered control of
Belgium, and he fought bravely for peace against King
and ministers and people. Non-intervention was the
word that he pleaded unceasingly at London and
thundered at Paris. There is a story that when someone
at London asked him to define non-intervention he
said it was “a metaphysical and political term that
meant pretty much the same thing as intervention.”
He may have said so for the fun of the phrase,
but his correspondence with Paris shows that he was
in deepest earnest about it.</p>

<p>His policy at London was perfectly straight, but
unfortunately his diplomatic history made many hesitate
to accept it as such. It is said that once under the
Empire some piece of news relating to Spain had reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
the knowledge of the Spanish Minister, and Napoleon
grumbled. Talleyrand said he would put the matter
right. He went to M. d’Azara, said that he had
something important to whisper to him regarding his
country, and then told him precisely the piece of news
that had leaked out. D’Azara was so far unable to
conceive Talleyrand speaking the truth in such a matter
that he concluded the whole story was a hoax, and wrote
to his Government to disregard the information he had
sent them. At London in 1830 and 1831 Talleyrand
was pleading in perfect sincerity for non-intervention,
but Palmerston (who came to the Foreign Office in
November) and others were unable to believe him. The
more he assured them of his struggle against his own
Government, the more they suspected him. Palmerston
dreaded his diplomatic ascendancy, and looked for his
secret inspiration in every movement towards war and
territorial expansion that was reported from Paris.</p>

<p>There was no unreality about Talleyrand’s statement
that he was fighting his own Government. In
November they sent Count Flahaut to assist him in
London and induce him to favour the scheme of a
partition of Belgium between Holland, England, Prussia,
and France. Talleyrand told him he would cut off his
right hand before signing such a treaty, and sent him
back to Paris. Sebastiani (Foreign Minister) then
sounded Talleyrand on a scheme for making the King’s
son, the Duc de Nemours, King of Belgium, and was
told that it was a “mad idea.” Talleyrand, in fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
resorted to the device of writing constantly to the
King’s sister, Mme. Adélaide, and told her the Duke
“must absolutely refuse” the Belgian crown if it were
offered to him. He believed that Belgium would not
remain a distinct nation (in which his sagacity failed
altogether), and might eventually fall to France, but for
the moment it was “a secondary matter.” “We must
make France first,” he said. But the Congress at Brussels
on February 3rd did invite the Duc de Nemours to the
throne, and Paris wavered once more. Talleyrand
signed a protocol at London engaging France to refuse
the crown for the Duc de Nemours. Sebastiani complained
seriously, and Talleyrand had to submit, but
added that “if it seemed to him at any time that there
would be imminent danger of war if he refused to sign
the protocols of the Conference, and the real interests
of France were not at stake, he would sign them in
accordance with the first instructions given him,” and
threatened to leave London if the situation did not
improve in Paris. Moreover, when, under the influence
of a deputy from Brussels, the King wavered again, and
Sebastiani sent word that his reply was postponed,
Talleyrand refused to submit his message to Palmerston.</p>

<p>The Conference to which he alludes was sitting on
the Belgian question at London. When England proposed
an international Conference, Talleyrand was
instructed to demand that it be held at Paris, and he did
so. His personal opinion was, however, that Paris was
in too insecure a condition, and he was not disappointed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>when London was decided on. He had made up his
mind from the first that Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg
was the fittest candidate for the Belgian throne. To
this there was no serious opposition at London, and a
change of Ministry at Paris in March brought Casimir
Périer to the head of affairs. With this able statesman
and friend Talleyrand could make more progress, though
he described his advance on Ancona as “a piece of
filibustering.” By the middle of July Leopold was
accepted in Belgium, and the irritating problem was
settled.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="caption">TALLEYRAND<br />

(At London, in 1831).</p></div>




<p>But one difficulty was removed only to lead to
another. Talleyrand had in April (1831) obtained from
the Allies of 1815 a secret promise that some of the
fortresses raised at that time against France should be
demolished. Louis-Philippe wanted to be able to
announce this welcome decision in his July address.
As Talleyrand was dilatory in obtaining permission, the
King made the announcement and declared he would not
evacuate Belgium until the forts were destroyed. His
ambassador had meantime secured the assent of the
Powers, but had also signed a promise to evacuate
Belgium in August. The King was much annoyed, but
Talleyrand politely requested him and Périer not to
make so much noise about the fortresses. To a private
correspondent he wrote that he was tired to death of
fighting Paris, when his whole attention was needed at
London. He could see nothing but <i>amour propre</i> in the
agitation at Paris. The struggle continued for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
time. Louis-Philippe wanted different forts destroyed
from those that Talleyrand had named, and wrote angrily
to him. His ambassador sent a polite and sarcastic
reply, and the names of the forts remained unchanged
when the matter was settled in January. Talleyrand’s
weariness expressed itself in the following passage of a
letter to Sebastiani, which would probably be submitted
to Louis-Philippe: “The King knows that I am a
partisan of no dynasty. Since the days of Louis XVI
I have served all Governments out of attachment to my
country. I have abandoned them the moment they sacrificed
the interests of France to personal interests. If the
King is going to listen to domestic chatterers, he must not
count on me.” It was the voice of the King-maker.</p>

<p>At London he had maintained his diplomatic
ascendancy, though Palmerston annoyed him exceedingly.
There was a good deal of ill-natured carping
at his distinction. One day Lord Londonderry was
misguided enough to voice this in the House of Lords.
He referred to the influence of a certain “astute
diplomatist” over the Conference, and said it was
“disgusting” to see English Ministers in such assiduous
attendance on this man. Talleyrand, he peevishly
reminded them, had been the Minister of Napoleon, of
Louis, and of Charles, before he took the service of
Louis-Philippe. Lord Goderich protested that Talleyrand’s
character should have protected him from such
an attack, and then Wellington arose. After speaking
of his relations to Talleyrand, he said: “I have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
hesitation in saying that at that time, in every one of
the great transactions in which I have been engaged
with Prince Talleyrand, no man could have conducted
himself with more firmness and ability with regard to
his own country, or with more uprightness and honour
in all his communications with the Ministers of other
countries than Prince Talleyrand.... No man’s public
and private character had ever been so much belied as
both the public and private character of that individual.”
His words were greeted with loud cheers. Lord
Holland added that “forty years’ acquaintance with the
noble individual referred to enabled him to bear his
testimony to the fact that although those forty years
had been passed during a time peculiarly fraught with
calumnies of every description, there had been no man’s
private character more shamefully traduced, and no
man’s public character more mistaken and misrepresented,
than the private and public character of Prince
Talleyrand.” A visitor the next morning found the
aged diplomatist in tears, with the <i>Times</i> in his hand.
He wrote to a friend that “at Paris, for which he was
killing himself, no one would do as much for him.”
Cynics have not failed to point the moral. But it was
merely a grateful exaggeration. Casimir Périer wrote
to him soon afterwards: “Posterity will do you that
full justice which, in times of social agitation, those who
have charge of public interests must not expect from
their contemporaries.” Unfortunately, posterity still
likes to shudder over romantic wickedness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span></p>

<p>Casimir Périer died in May, and there were not a
few at Paris who thought of Talleyrand as his successor.
The Prince was rather bent on retiring from public life.
He went over to Paris, and found a condition of comparative
anarchy resulting from the death of the strong
leader. However, an abler Ministry than ever was got
together, and in October he returned to London. If the
chroniclers may be trusted, his wit had not diminished
with age. A poet of suspicious repute had issued a piece
on which his opinion was asked. “C’est que la corruption
engendre les vers,” he replied. A more questionable
story is that he found Montrond one day in a fit on the
floor, clawing at the carpet with his nails. “It looks as
if he is quite determined to go down,” he is described
as saying.</p>

<p>The Belgian trouble was still unsettled, and in
October he signed a convention with England to compel
the Dutch to retire from Antwerp in obedience to the
Conference. French troops were sent into Belgium, the
Prussians massed a considerable force on the frontier,
and this was a brief period of great anxiety. The
Dutch did not finally yield until May, 1833. But
this difficulty had scarcely disappeared before a fresh
one arose. The Sultan of Turkey had appealed to
Russia for help in subduing a rebellious vassal, and
signed a treaty with the Tsar in July. The French
were, however, jealous of Russian interference, and
Talleyrand had to press at London for joint action.
Nothing was done, however, when Russia anticipated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
them, though there was no slight risk of war at
one time.</p>

<p>The crown and end of Talleyrand’s work in England
came in April, 1834, when he signed the alliance between
England, France, Spain, and Portugal. In August of
that year he left England, and shortly afterwards resigned
his position of ambassador. A number of reasons for
this step are assigned in his letters at the time, though
his age and the completion of his work at London by an
alliance might be deemed sufficient. To Lady Jersey
he spoke of a personal affliction, which is surmised to
have been the death of the Countess Tyszkiewitz. To
Mme. Adélaide he complained of his growing infirmity
of the legs, and the behaviour of Palmerston; and also
that her son, the Duc d’Orléans, had been telling his
own English guests at Valençay that he was past work.
He declared to Von Gagern that he “only quitted
affairs because there were none to attend to”; while to
the King he explained that he had now secured “the
right of citizenship” for France in Europe, and his
work was over. All these motives influenced him, no
doubt; but there was another one, of some interest.
He had witnessed at London the growing agitation for
reform, and completely failed to appreciate it. As the
agitation wore on, he spoke moodily of the state of
France in 1789. The convocation of the first reformed
parliament in 1833 he described as “the States-General
of London.” He was too old to understand the new
movement, to see a permanent and proper advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
beneath all the menacing clamour. England was no
longer “so rich and peaceful.” He wrote slightingly
to the King of her value to France, and thought rather
of a coalition of Europe against what he thought to be
a rising tide of anarchy.</p>

<p>He resisted, therefore, the kindly pressure of the
King and retired to Valençay. “There is,” he wrote to
a correspondent, “an interval between life and death
that should be employed in dying decently.” There
still remained three or four years of life. It is said that
he offered to go as ambassador to Vienna in 1835, but
Louis-Philippe was apprehensive of advances being made
to him by the Bourbons. In that year were published,
in the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>, George Sand’s outrageous
<i>Lettres d’un voyageur</i>. Imagining her traveller to stand
by moonlight before the chateau of Valençay, she puts
into his mouth some of the most repulsive calumnies
against Talleyrand, as the silhouetted forms appear at the
windows. The subject of her ridiculous nightmares
was then an old man in his eighty-first year, peacefully
concluding his memoirs and passing the last slow days
in the company of the Duchess of Dino and her young
daughter, Pauline. Maubreuil was hardly less chivalrous.
George Sand was a not distant neighbour, and her
description of his “daily round” may be less imaginative.
He rose at eleven, and spent three or four
hours (?) in the hands of his valets. At three he had
a drive round the park with his doctor, and at five
enjoyed “the most succulent and artistic dinner in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>France.” After a few words to his family, he would
drive in the park again until eleven, and then work in
his own room until five o’clock. Visitors still made
their pilgrimages to Valençay. We find Sir Robert and
Lady Peel there in 1836. His mind is described as
retaining its vigour and perspicacity, but by the end of
1835 loss of power in the legs began to foreshadow the
end. His temperate habits had their reward in good
general health. It is said that after death his organs&mdash;apart
from the local trouble&mdash;were found to be
singularly sound for an octogenarian.<br /><br /></p>

<p>On his eighty-third birthday he wrote a few lines
that reveal the pain and weariness that were growing on
him. He concluded a rather gloomy summary of his
long life with the words: “What result from it all but
physical and moral exhaustion, a complete discouragement
as to the future and disdain for the past.” On that
day he had asked Dupanloup to dinner, but the rector
of Saint Sulpice pleaded his work in excuse. “He does
not know his business,” said Talleyrand with a smile.
For some time the Prince had been importuned from
many sides to make his peace with the Church. It is
said that on one occasion at Valençay he incautiously
asked the little Pauline one Sunday where she had been.
“I have been to mass,” she said, “to pray the good God
to give you better sentiments.” The Duchess of Dino
was deeply anxious to see him reconciled. Letters
reached him from very old friends with the same aim.
Royer-Collard advised it. The Archbishop of Paris,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
Mgr. Quelen, who had been coadjutor to his uncle, was
pressing as far as discretion allowed. He had obtained
instructions from Rome as to the minimum that need
be asked of the illustrious apostate. In 1835 he had
received the dying Princess Talleyrand into the Church,
and made it an occasion for a strong appeal to her
husband. Talleyrand politely thanked him for his
interest.</p>

<p>What was the real state of Talleyrand’s mind in
regard to religion as he approached the end? It is
quite impossible to discover it with certainty. It seems
probable that throughout life Talleyrand maintained an
attitude of agnosticism, standing between the dogmatic
theism or dogmatic atheism of his friends. It seems
clear, too, that his agnosticism had not very deep
philosophic roots, and it would not be unnatural for
it to yield under the pressure of approaching death. It
is true that he often uses theistic expressions in his
letters from 1814 onwards, but that may be merely a
concession to the new fashions introduced with the new
monarchy. Napoleon had openly described him as a
man who “did not believe in God.” But there are two
facts that strongly dispose us to take a diplomatic view
of Talleyrand’s “reconciliation.” The first is that he
had a strong incentive to go through the form of
submission. There were frequently disorderly scenes
at the funerals of his non-Christian friends, and he
betrayed a great concern lest his own exit from the stage
should be marred by the same disorder. He even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
spoke towards the end of leaving France, and it was
thought that he wanted to die out of the country so as
to be buried in peace without submission. And the
second fact is the way in which he postponed the act of
reconciliation until the very last and inevitable moment,
as we shall see.</p>

<p>In March his life-long friend, Count Reinhard,
died, and Talleyrand read a paper on him at the Institut.
The hall was crowded with scholars and politicians, and
Talleyrand was greeted with a remarkable ovation. He
read his paper in a strong and sonorous voice, and then
made his way from the room between two compact
hedges of admirers, who bowed their heads as he passed.
“A greater than Voltaire,” cried Victor Cousin. There
is little in the oration to explain the enthusiasm. To us,
indeed, who read it in full consciousness of Talleyrand’s
whole career, and not merely in connection with his last
work at London, it has a curious look. The only
passage of particular interest is where he describes the
qualities that make the great diplomatist. Of these
“good faith” is the first. He protests against the
“prejudice” that conceives diplomacy as “a science of
ruse and duplicity.” “If good faith is ever necessary it
is in political transactions.” The passage rings with
perfect sincerity; but the tradition that Talleyrand’s
successes have left in the school of diplomacy is of
a very different kind. The speech was plain and ineloquent.
Lady Blennerhasset thinks Talleyrand had
nearly every gift of this life bestowed on him except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
“respect.” It is impossible to see in the splendid
enthusiasm evoked by his last public appearance at
Paris anything else but a great demonstration of
respect.</p>

<p>The suppuration in his legs ceased some time
before his death, and he spoke cheerfully of a journey
to Italy, but in April the last symptoms made their
appearance. He bore his pain with great restraint
and dignity. Dupanloup’s scruples had been overruled
by the archbishop, and he was now a frequent visitor
at the Hotel St. Florentin. There seems to have been
no conversation about religion in these visits, but there
was a business-like arrangement of terms. Until the
end of March he politely evaded all Dupanloup’s
attempts to make an opening. At last he promised
the duchess he would summon the priest if he fell
seriously ill. He then submitted to him a draft of a
recantation, but as it contained an implication that he
had been free to marry, Dupanloup had to reject it,
and proposed another form on May 12th. He watched
Talleyrand’s face with great eagerness as he read it,
but not a muscle moved. The Prince asked him to
leave it.</p>

<p>Anthrax had set in on May 11th, and all Paris was
interested in the end of the great diplomatist and the
question of reconciliation. Candles were burning in
every chapel in the city. Messengers were running to
and fro between Saint Sulpice and the archbishop’s house,
as they had run so many times between foreign embassies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
when Talleyrand was obstinate. On the evening of the
16th he was visibly sinking, and his niece implored him
to sign the form. He promised to do so at six in the
morning. When he grew worse during the night, and
they pressed him to sign, he observed it was not yet six.
When the hour came Dupanloup sent in to him the little
Pauline dressed for her first communion, and as Talleyrand
caressed her the clock struck six. Dupanloup and
the witnesses entered, and Talleyrand signed. “I have
never ceased,” the paper ended, “to regard myself as a
child of the Church. I again deplore the actions of my
life that have caused it pain, and my last wishes are for
its supreme head.” Dupanloup had politely refrained
from inserting such phrases as “sin” and “repentance.”
It was a gracious acknowledgment of errors committed
in a wayward age. This was the price of a peaceful and
honourable burial. Gregory XVI is said to have
described it as one of the triumphs of his reign. The
document was antedated two months.</p>

<p>During the day the King came to bid him farewell.
Talleyrand was greatly moved at the honour, and received
the King ceremoniously. Dupanloup was in constant
attendance, and succeeded in inducing him to confess and
receive the sacraments. As the day wore on he became
more and more exhausted, and approached the end. In
the adjoining room all Paris was waiting for the close.
Statesmen, nobles and scholars, young and old, were
gathered in little groups before the curtain that cut off
the bedroom from the library. At a quarter to four the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
doctor was called, and there was a general movement
towards the door. The curtain was drawn back, and all
saw the figure of the Prince. He sat on the edge of the
bed supported by two servants&mdash;a “dying lion,” says
one witness. His long, white hair now hung loosely
about the pallid and shrunken face. The head drooped
on the chest, but now and again he slowly raised it and
looked with the last faint shadow of a smile on the great
crowd that had come to pay the tribute of France. It
was a “grand spectacle,” said Royer-Collard; the fall of
“the last cedar of Lebanon.” He “died in public,”
“died amidst regal pomp and reverence,” say other eyewitnesses.
The duchess and her daughter knelt by the
bedside. He was conscious to the end&mdash;conscious that
his career was ending amidst a manifestation of love,
power and profound respect as great as he could ever
have wished.</p>

<p>He was accorded by State and Church the funeral
of a prince. In the Church of the Assumption, where he
was to be interred until the vault was ready at Valençay,
an imposing ceremony was held, at which Europe was
represented. Over the catafalque on which his worn
frame lay was emblazoned by priestly hands the motto
of his house: “Re que Diou”&mdash;I lived so high
that God alone towered above me. It was his last
triumph.</p>

<p>The story-tellers close their version of his career
with the statement that, as the cortége started some
time after for the gates of Paris, to take the body to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
Valençay, and the driver called out the usual question:
“Which barrier?” a deep voice replied from underneath
the hearse: “La barrière de l’Enfer.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt2">*****</span></p>

<p>That there are unanswered and perhaps unanswerable
questions in regard to Talleyrand’s career must be
admitted: that his personality is obscure and enigmatic
can no longer be maintained. The work of successive
historians and biographers, which I have put together in
succinct form in this study, has made him intelligible.
When we set aside demonstrable myths and legends,
and when we decline to entertain the vicious charges of
his enemies that are unsupported by other testimony,
we have a tolerably clear character and consistent career.</p>

<p>We see a boy of many excellent qualities thrust
into a school of hypocrisy, a youth of sensuous and
amorous temper and sceptical views admitted into a
Church that asks no serious questions, a sincere patriot
serving a country that deliberately changes its rulers
five times in the course of his life. The tortuousness
is largely in the path marked out for him. A refined
epicurean, but no sybarite, he set out with deliberate
intent to enjoy life. It is no injustice to point out
that he fell short in practice of ideals of personal and
political asceticism that he never even respected in
theory. A certain laxity of morals, a disposition to pass
over in silence the misdeeds of those who employed
him, a readiness to take money for service done, were
parts or consequences of his map of life. He was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
Stoic, and would be the last to expect us to strain his
character into harmony with Stoic ideals.</p>

<p>But if Talleyrand chose the comfortable valleys
instead of scaling the arduous heights of great personal
or political virtue, he had, none the less, distinct graces of
character. Few men of recent times have been so
heavily and so successfully calumniated. He was not
licentious, nor corrupt, nor vindictive, nor treacherous,
nor devoid of idealism. He was humane, generous,
affectionate, a sincere patriot, a lover of justice and
peace. He sought a comfortable existence, but he
desired to avoid inflicting pain or discomfort on others.
He was sensitive of the honour of France, proud of her
greatness, happy in serving her with distinction. He
was a kind master, a genial and liberal friend, a lover of
domestic peace and harmony. He sought throughout
his career to disarm violence, prevent bloodshed, resist
oppression, and help on the reign of good taste, good
sense and good feeling.</p>

<p>His political career is to-day free from ambiguity.
He was a Churchman by accident and the fault of
others. He did right in abandoning the Church. Some
of his Catholic royal critics in 1815 declared that the
mistake of his life was not to have clung to the Church,
and enjoyed his wine and his mistress in the tranquility
and comfort of the cardinalate. He was not low enough
in character for that. He behaved towards the Church
he had left with a moderation and absence of passion that
is rare in the embittered and calumniated apostate. Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
a single change in his later political career can be
seriously challenged. In later years he said, in varying
phraseology, that he had never conspired except with
the whole of France, and had never deserted a cause
until it had deserted itself or common sense. He had
no belief in the divine right of either kings or mobs;
and no ruler he met had charm enough or real greatness
enough to win from him a personal allegiance. With
his last breath (and in his will) he spoke tenderly of
Napoleon, and commended the ex-Emperor’s family
to his heirs. He served France more in deserting
Louis XVI than those who remained faithful; and his
successive desertion of the Directors, Napoleon, and
Charles X needs no defence. The only rational ground
of censure is that he kept so entirely together his
personal interest and the high cause of France and
humanity that he served through all these vicissitudes
of his country. This will withhold from him for ever
the title of self-forgetting greatness, the nobler
enthusiasm, which we so fitly reverence, of losing
sight of self at times in an exalted cause. He made
his choice, and he will abide by it.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The date is variously given as February 2nd or 13th, and even
March. The first seems to be correct. Dupanloup speaks of the Prince
celebrating his eighty-fourth birthday on that date. But the myth-making
faculty has been so busy with the life of Talleyrand that his
very birthplace and parentage have been disputed. It will prepare the
reader for the wild legends we shall encounter to learn at once that
serious French writers have attributed Talleyrand’s lameness to a
congenital defect or to an encounter with a savage sow, and that serious
American writers (<i>Bookman</i>, September 26, 1901) have asked us to
consider gravely a story of his having been born at Mount Desert, Maine,
the illegitimate son of an American fisher-girl and a French naval officer.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Mr. Holland Rose (<i>Life of Napoleon</i>) is entirely wrong in speaking
of his “resentment against his parents.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> I have already ignored scores of stories about Talleyrand’s youth.
The biographer has to plunge beneath a mass of them to reach his true
subject. A discharged secretary of his, who could imitate his signature,
flooded Paris and London with fabricated letters and anecdotes, and he
had many rivals in the business. Writers like Bastide, Pichot,
Villemarest, Michaud, Stewartson, Touchard-Lafosse, and even Sainte-Beuve,
readily admit these, and some of the best biographies contain a
few that are inconsistent with known facts. Such are the stories of his
chalking Voltairean verses on his uncle’s garden wall, and of (in the
following year) scaling the walls of Saint Sulpice by night, seducing a whole
family, and being imprisoned in the Bastille. The dates or other features
betray these apocryphal legends.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Lady Blennerhassett and most biographers wrongly describe him
as a priest. He was not ordained until four years later. The archives
of the Sorbonne, in registering his application in April and June, 1775,
speak of him as a sub-deacon.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> On the strength of this absurd story historians like Professor Sloane
inform their readers that Talleyrand “was a friend of the infamous
Mme. du Barry, and owed his promotion to her.” So the legendary
Talleyrand still lingers in serious literature. The story contains a gross
anachronism, and the mere fact of the abbey being at Rheims points at
once to the influence of Archbishop Talleyrand having obtained it for
his nephew.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> I speak throughout the work of livres (=francs) unless I state otherwise.

<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> I do not know whether it is necessary to point out that, though
Talleyrand was one of the most tactful and forbearing of men, he was
bound to create numbers of enemies. When he passed on from the
clergy and nobility to the Revolution, from the Directorate to Napoleon,
from Napoleon to the Restoration, and finally from the Bourbons to the
Orleanists, he left a shoal of bitter enemies behind him at each step.
His personality, his caustic wit, and his curious experiences, formed an
excellent nucleus for legends to gather about. You have to pick your
way through hundreds of these to reach the real Talleyrand.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> The date is not certain, however. Talleyrand speaks of going to
Marly, and of seeing M. d’Artois just before he left France. But the
Court had left Marly a week before the emigration began. We must
suppose there were several visits, and must fix this one, in which he
urged strong measures, by the political circumstances. Such measures
Footnote: would certainly not be possible in the middle of July, where M. de Bacourt
would put the interview; they would have a plausible value up to
June 24th. Talleyrand probably did see d’Artois again later. The fact of
the interview and the substance of the conversation were afterwards
admitted by the Prince.</p></div>

by Pallain) were obviously written or dictated by Talleyrand. At the end
of the report of May 28th Chauvelin is made to say very pointedly that,
though he alone signs, “<i>nous</i>” means all three of them. In one dispatch
Talleyrand thus describes the English (for whom he had a genuine
regard: there is not a sharp or sarcastic word about them in these
letters): “A nation slow and methodical by temperament, and which,
unceasingly occupied with its commercial interests, does not care to be
constantly diverted from it by political controversy.” He is explaining
why the French Revolution has little echo in England.</p></div>

France. His fine collection passed under the hammer at Sotheby’s in
April (1793). The sale lasted ten days and realised more than £2,000.
Talleyrand puts it at £700, but I have seen a catalogue with the prices
filled in. Another somewhat mysterious sale of a French diplomatist’s
library took place at Sotheby’s in 1816, realising £8,000. The King’s
librarian describes this collection also as having belonged to Talleyrand,
and in that case the earlier sale would not represent his whole library.
But we shall see that it is almost impossible to trace the second sale to
Talleyrand.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_26_26" id="Footnote_26_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> I have referred already to a legend assigning his birth to America.
The only foundation for this is that he visited Mount Desert, and, as he
limped about, reminded the older inhabitants of a lame boy, born there of
a French officer and American girl in 1754, and afterwards taken to France.
In spite of the fact that Talleyrand’s father was a distinguished noble of
high character attached to Versailles; that the father’s wife, daughter of
the Marquis d’Antigny, acknowledged Charles Maurice to her death in
1809, and was supported by him in her later years; that the interest in
him of his great-grandmother, his uncle, and every member and friend of
the family was known to all France; this legend has been put forward in
America (<i>Bookman</i>, September 26th, 1901) as worthy of serious consideration.
There is hardly another character in recent history about
whom myths have been so blindly entertained.</p></div>

Talleyrand met Mme. Grand before he became Minister. Mme. Rémusat
makes her come to his ministerial bureau for a passport at their first
meeting.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_28_28" id="Footnote_28_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_28"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> Let me add, too, that the letter is full of gratitude to her. “I love

<p><a name="Footnote_29_29" id="Footnote_29_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> The Cambridge “French Revolution” states that they asked £50,000
for Talleyrand, and the 32 million francs for the Directors! A minor slip
in the Cambridge “America” makes the agents claim 50,000 dollars “for
each Director.” Some of the Directors were honourable men.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_30_30" id="Footnote_30_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> Professor Sloane informs America that Talleyrand was forced to
resign “in consequence of his scandalous attempt to extort a bribe from
the American envoys.” It is of a piece with Sloane’s whole reckless
reference to Talleyrand. He would have us believe that Talleyrand was
from the beginning in the pay of Napoleon; and so he contrives to be
ignorant of the fact that when Napoleon left Toulon for Egypt in May, 1798,
<i>Talleyrand gave him</i> 100,000 francs.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_31_31" id="Footnote_31_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> Thus, the list includes 1,500,000 made on change during the English
negotiations, and 2,000,000 as a share in the prizes taken at sea. It also
includes 1,000,000 from Austria for the insertion of the secret articles in
the Treaty of Campo Formio (on which Talleyrand had no influence whatever),
and 1,000,000 from Prussia for preventing the fulfilment of these
articles, and so on.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_32_32" id="Footnote_32_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_32"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> Napoleon speaks in his memoirs of Talleyrand dreading to meet him
on account of his failure to follow him to the East, and making every effort
to win his favour. It is absurd. Talleyrand knew precisely what he was
worth to Napoleon. All Napoleon’s later remarks on Talleyrand must be
read with discrimination; many of them are obvious untruths.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_33_33" id="Footnote_33_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_33"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> Lady Blennerhassett misses the subtlety of the distinction when she
suggests that Talleyrand attempted to play a double game with Napoleon
on this occasion. Compare Mr. Holland Rose’s version: “Talleyrand
took the most unscrupulous care that the affair of the Presidency should
be judiciously settled.” Standing between the two I should say he took
most “scrupulous care” to have Napoleon’s wish realised. The full
passage in the memoirs runs: “Je m’ouvris à Melzi, non pas sur ce que
le Premier Consul désirait, mais sur ce qu’il fallait que la République
Cisalpine demandat. En peu de jours je parvins à mon but. Au moment
que Bonaparte arriva á Lyons, tout était préparé, &amp;c.”</p></div>

legendary Talleyrand. The more candid observer would be disposed to
refer it to his lameness. We know that Talleyrand had to keep a heavy

easily understand his preference for lying in bed or on a couch.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_49_49" id="Footnote_49_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49_49"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> I have earlier described the sale of Talleyrand’s first library at
London in 1794. I have seen a second catalogue, of the year 1816, in
which the library of a “foreign nobleman, distinguished for his diplomatic
talents,” is put up at Sotheby’s. This must have been taken as a reference
to Talleyrand, and the King’s librarian explicitly describes the books
as his. The sale lasted eighteen days and produced £8,000. But it is
almost impossible to believe that the library was Talleyrand’s. The books
are described as having been consigned from France in 1814, and as the
finest collection ever put at auction. By that time Talleyrand’s anxiety
was over, and he could not have taken the extreme step of selling a
superb library. Either the books were <i>sold</i> in 1812, or they were not
Talleyrand’s.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_50_50" id="Footnote_50_50"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50_50"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> Napoleonists are naturally very ready with accusations against
Talleyrand at this time. Maret, besides impugning his advice in the
matter of Ferdinand, hints that he secretly sent word to the Allies of the
state of feeling in France, and the slight resistance the Emperor could
make to their advance. It is impossible to weigh seriously irresponsible
charges of that kind. Still less serious is Bourrienne’s statement that
he advised Napoleon to win over the Duke of Wellington by offering
him the throne of Spain. Such a suggestion ought to enable English
readers to appreciate fully the recklessness of Napoleonist charges against
Talleyrand.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_51_51" id="Footnote_51_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51_51"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> The drama would not be complete without the suggestion of a plot
on Talleyrand’s part to assassinate Napoleon. I will deal with this later.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_52_52" id="Footnote_52_52"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52_52"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> A stupid story is told by Vaulabelle, and greatly embroidered by
some of the romanticists, that the Duchess of Courland’s daughter was
seen joining in wild orgies on the night of April 2nd, and riding on
horseback behind a Cossack. One of Talleyrand’s letters to the duchess
unconsciously reveals the germ of this monstrous story. Talleyrand had
sent a Cossack escort to accompany her back to Paris from Rosny that
evening on account of the mob.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_53_53" id="Footnote_53_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53_53"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> Talleyrand probably gives the more correct version. Both he and
Beugnot make the King say: “We were the cleverer. If you had been
so, you would say to me: ‘Let us sit down and talk.’ Instead of that I
say to you: ‘Take a seat and talk to me.’” Talleyrand says the King
was speaking of their remote ancestors and the relative positions their
families had won in France. Beugnot would have it that the emigrant
party had been the cleverer in 1789. But it is impossible to understand
the words in this sense. They would imply that Talleyrand had aimed
at the throne.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_54_54" id="Footnote_54_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_54"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> The determination to have Murat deposed and Naples restored to
Ferdinand is one of the cardinal points. This was insisted on by Louis
XVIII as a family accommodation. It was not less advisable for France
generally. Murat was too near Elba, as the sequel showed. Yet an able
French critic of Talleyrand, M. Ollivier (<i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>,
September 15th 1894), has so far strained, perverted and ignored the
evidence as to say Talleyrand first corresponded with Murat, and got
1,250,000 francs from him, and <i>then</i> turned against him and obtained
several millions from Ferdinand. The blind hostility of Sainte Beuve is
not yet extinct at Paris. Ollivier’s whole case is founded on Sainte
Beuve’s “remarkable study” (a happy phrase!), Pasquier’s “judicious”
memoirs and the wild charges of Savary, Chateaubriand and Napoleon.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_55_55" id="Footnote_55_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55_55"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> It is also clear that presents more frequently took the form of cash
then than they do now. Ambassadors of historic and wealthy families
could afford the luxury of disdaining money. Talleyrand had not a franc
of hereditary wealth; and his diplomatic pre-eminence entailed enormous
expenditure. To-day no man of character or culture could be offered
money. Talleyrand lived in an age of transition, and was a cynic.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_56_56" id="Footnote_56_56"></a><a href="#FNanchor_56_56"><span class="label">[56]</span></a> Pasquier does not name her. Lady Blennerhassett thinks it was
the Duchess of Dino. It is much more likely to have been the Duchess of
Courland, her mother, as we find the daughter in touch with Talleyrand.
The Duchy of Dino had been given to the Foreign Minister by Ferdinand
IV, and he had assigned it to his nephew.</p></div>
